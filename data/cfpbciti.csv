On XX/XX/2020 ( twenty-three days after filing the dispute with Citi ), Citi finally updated me via email with news that Citi : 1 ) had heard back from the Merchant, 2 ) would review the information the Merchant provided, and 3 ) would get back to me within ten business days. 

Ten business days passed with ZERO updates from Citi about my dispute. On XX/XX/2020, I called Citi and spoke to a representative who could offer no explanation as to why I had not been updated or why Citi so severely mismanaged my expectations about my dispute over the hefty {$4100.00} sum. The representative simply said she would send an email to the investigator, reminding the investigator to give me the update I never received, and added the turnaround process would take an additional seven to ten business days! As a result, you can imagine my enormous level of frustration and feelings of being lied to by Citi. 

Meanwhile, many others who have experienced the same issue with the Merchant, but used XXXX to book their travel, have already received permanent credits for their disputed amounts. You can read their stories, along with many others who have gotten nowhere about this issue with Citi, within the XXXX group SCAMMED by book it. 

Lastly, I will mention that I have not been asked for any documentation by Citi that will support my claim, though I have plenty. Does anyone at Citi even care? Below are items that support my case, which I will also upload with my complaint. 

1. The Merchants terms and conditions. 
2. A screenshot with today 's date ( XX/XX/2020 ) of the Merchants website showing no refund has been paid. 
3. A screenshot of the Merchants homepage saying they are unable to process refunds and for people to contact their banks for available options as cardholders. 
4. A consumer complaint form with the Texas Attorney General and documentation of filing a complaint with the Florida Attorney General. 
5. Complaint filed with the XXXX XXXX XXXX Police department about the Merchant. 

Do you know what it says on Citis homepage? We are here to help. I do not feel like Citi has helped me at all regarding this dispute. 

More specifically, at https : //citi.com/citi/about/data/citi_commitment_summary.pdf? ieNocache=624, under Citis Commitment, it says , During  these uncertain times, Citi remains well-positioned from a capital and liquidity perspective.

I spoke to XXXX in billing disputes on XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX XXXX. He stated dispute XXXX for {$14.00} dated XX/XX/XXXX and disputed on XX/XX/XXXX for {$14.00} was a permanent credit with no additional documentation required. It was resolved in my favor on XX/XX/XXXX, the same day my conditional credit for dispute was issued on my statement and my transaction history. XXXX stated the merchant was not paid on this transaction. In direct contrast, dispute XXXX for {$29.00} dated XX/XX/XXXX and disputed on XX/XX/XXXX was also a permanent credit with no additional documentation required. It was resolved on XX/XX/XXXX, the same day my conditional credit for dispute was issued on my statement and my transaction history. XXXX stated despite issuing a credit in my favor, the merchant was paid on this transaction. According to Citibanks executive team ( XXXX and XXXX ), Citibank had been issuing me permanent credits, but when a merchant disagreed, they were also paying the merchant. Then, they would charge the amount off on their P & L sheets and would code my dispute as misrepresented. To date, Citibank has not provided me with a full list of the so-called misrepresented disputes despite asking them in writing through their billing disputes department, asking for the documentation through the CFPB, as well as verbally asking for documentation to their XXXX number within their billing disputes department. I get contradictory answers. 
I have spoken to the store manager, XXXX, at the XXXX  XXXX. I have also spoken to his district manager, XXXX XXXX. XXXX remembered my prior complaints through the website and also the XXXX  complaint I filed against the location back in XXXX. The prior manager, XXXX, never followed up with me despite advising XXXX that he had. XXXX is no longer employed with XXXX XXXX. XXXX apologized for the problems. I told him I had withdrawn dispute XXXX for {$29.00} and asked him to directly refund me. He stated he couldnt do a refund this far along on my credit card, but he agreed to send me a gift certificate with a receipt, and said he would be willing to speak to Citibank if needed. I explained the entire problem to him and he went as far to research it through their accounting department. On XXXX, I received a gift card for {$44.00} which is well over the disputed amount. It appears he refunded me for both charges despite telling him Citibank had not paid them on the other dispute. 
So, I am asking that Citibank recode the disputes to reflect them as not misrepresented. I am sending a copy of the e-mail I am sending to billing disputes, copies of the gift card and the receipt ( feel free to call the number on the back of the card to verify the dollar amount ), screen prints of my dispute summary for the disputes, and a copy of the e-mail interaction between myself, XXXX, and XXXX.

Their customer service representatives are not able to do much about it because of Citibank policies even though most of them said they would eliminate if they could. They have also done what they can to hurt my credit over this matter that was caused by their customer service not seeing a balance. 

Citibank management must be a very obnoxious rude group. I will stop using their card and suggest others do as well. Card ends in XXXX and was closed today.

I immediately contacted customer service and my account was subsequently closed. 

I have reason to believe Citibank is in the practice of reducing credit limits due to the coronavirus on low risk consumers who do not have any problems with payment history or debt load. 

I received a follow up letter in the mail stating that I have high debts with other creditors which is simply not true. I have very little credit card debt, and all accounts are in perfect standing. I have other accounts with CitiBank that are paid in full.

02/14/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"XXXX I have contacted Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX the to report my card lost and filed a dispute for unauthorized transactions. On XX/XX/XXXX, Citibank responded with a generic letter stating that the withdrawals were made from my account with my card and that my debit card and PIN were used to perform the withdrawals which is consistent with normal activities. 
First of all, if that wasn't my account and my card, I wouldn't have contacted Citibank. Second of all this is not consistent with my normal banking activities since I rarely withdraw money from the account. Third, this is absolutely not consistent with normal banking activities because I can't perform withdrawals which dispersed both bills and cents because that exactly what is being presented. 
I told Citibank that I had people moving my staff to a different location and that I had a big envelope which contained my XXXX XXXX account disclosure, my XXXX XXXX card, my XXXX XXXX card PIN written on a piece of paper which is the same as my Citibank debit card, and finally my Citibank debit card in the envelope. The envelope containing my cards was among the staffs that were packed. I kept only one card ( XXXX XXXX debit card ) on me which was used for my daily expenses. 
So, after a week or so of packing and moving my staffs to a new location, I realized that the big envelope was missing along with few other staffs. So, I contacted the people that did the moving but couldn't get in touch with any of them. The next day, I couldn't locate my Citibank debit card which I didn't know that I left it in the envelope that got lost. 
Both of my cards ( XXXX XXXX  card and Citibank card ) have been used to withdraw money out of both accounts. However, I received a text message from XXXX XXXX  Fraud department asking if I am attempting to withdraw a certain amount of money which they said was not consistent with my normal banking activities. On the flip side, I have never received text messages, calls, emails from Citibank asking the same. I told XXXX XXXX  that I wasn't trying to withdraw money out of my account. The bank took the necessary steps to close my card and prevent money to be disbursed Citibank never took these preventive steps. Also, it appears that the transactions were done overseas which should have been another red flag for Citibank to noticed like XXXX XXXX did. I was using my XXXX XXXX   account during the time that the time the unauthorized transactions were made. Therefore, I can't be in two different opposite locations at the same time. 
I have attached a copy of the text message sent to me by XXXX XXXX, a copy of my XXXX XXXX  account transactions showing dates and places where I used my card, a copy of store receipts showing dates confirming my locations, and a XXXX XXXX  showing unauthorized transactions that was blocked or reversed. 
Citibank conduct. 
1. Citibank bank never used preventive methods to prevent the unauthorized transactions which is Reckless 2. Citibank Bank conducted their investigation through a third party who did not bother listen about how the incident happened. ( again Reckless ) 3. Better yet, I volunteered to give them all the additional information that I had to make sure my claim was properly handled. They refused! Beyond Reckless! 
4. Citibank sent me a generic letter without explaining the why the case was denied! Frustrating!

5. I am protected by the zero-liability protection!

Not only Citibank did not take preventive measures to prevent the unauthorized transactions but have conducted a reckless investigation before sending me a frustrating letter with no proof no evidences to deny my claim.

This shows that Citibank is an irresponsible bank and is only focus on ripping customers off.

Citibank has been caught up in a series of scandals and this time around they dont even bother rely on anytime to evade their responsibilities.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must take action to make sure that I am protected from those unfair acts and practices and I urge Citibank to resolve this claim as quickly as possible before I file a lawsuit.

Failure to provide concrete evidences that I authorized these transactions, Citibank is obligated by federal laws to reimburse these unauthorized transactions.

05/09/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"I had a credit card with Citibank that I originally got to so my Dad could have a credit card to use if he was in a tough situation ( he had relatively poor credit for a while so he couldn't get a lot of credit cards ). After a while, my Dad 's credit improved so neither him nor I used the card a lot, and thus I wasn't checking the statement often. Around XX/XX/XXXX, the card was hit with a fraudulent charge from an online vendor, and since neither of use used the account and thus weren't actively checking the statement, it accumulated a late fee due to a charge being put on the card that neither of us knew about. I told Citibank that the charge was fraudulent and wanted to dispute it and that I should have the late fee taken off since it was an honest mistake, and if they wouldn't take off the fee, I wanted to close my account. 

Citibank representatives then told me that if I wanted to dispute the charge, I could not close my account. They later agreed with me that the charge was fraudulent and removed the charge from account in XXXX of XXXX. Even though I didn't want the card anymore, though, they forced me to pay the late fee and keep the account active so I would have to pay an annual membership fee of {$100.00} ( which they charged to me literally on XXXX XXXX of XXXX ). 

I paid the fee on XX/XX/XXXX, but then was charged with a late fee of {$25.00} and an interest fee XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, even though I paid the bill on time and thus should have accumulated neither of those fees. 

I then began trying to dispute this with Citibank. I would spend hours on end trying to speak with representative over chat, but they kept on saying they had high chat volumes and thus could not have an employee speak to me. Even though I would try at least 1x a week for the next two months to talk to an employee, they charged me two more late fees over the coming months and reported me to collections, which caused my credit score to decrease by over 50 points, from XXXX to XXXX. 

Finally, I relented and paid a late fee of {$88.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and had them close my account for good. I was able to get through to an employee via phone and asked them to contact the credit agencies to explain their mistake so my credit could be restored. They then told that I had to mail a letter to a random PO Box in South Dakota to ask them to look into it, and I could not call or email anyone, but had to send a letter. 

The whole process was incredibly deceiving and that Citi was both forcing me to keep my card and was inadequately responding to me, and knew, based on chat messages I was sending ( that I was given no response to ), that I wanted to dispute the late fees. Additionally, Citibank sent me to collections for these illegitimate late fees, then told me I have to send a letter and can not email or phone anyone to get Citi to fix this. I asked why it is I have to send a letter and they said "" this is just the process. '' I asked if they are making me send a letter to dissuade me from contacting them and they did not deny this, again repeating that "" this is part of the process.

I have had the card for 10 yrs with a spotless record of paying for charges in a timely fashion. 
I called Citi and informed them of what had happened and asked for an explanation. A customer service employee told me a letter had just been sent explaining the situation but he couldn't give any more information because of my privacy rights. I asked to speak to a supervisor. 
A supervisor pulled up the letter sent to me and told me my account had been closed for "" non-usage '' and explained I had not used the card in at least 2 yrs. I countered that was probably true, I had several cards and I used each of them according to the scenario and I was sure, if he cared to look back, that there had been other 2 yr periods over the past 10 yrs when I had not used my Citi Card. I asked if I had ever signed any agreement or had been informed by Citi of their "" use it or lose it '' policy. The supervisor told me no, they simply had the right to close my account at any time for any reason. 
As you know, this affects my credit rating negatively and I informed the supervisor of the same. I think it patently unfair that my credit rating will go down - which could affect future credit requests on my part - simply because Citi precipitously cancelled my account. Further, I find it patently unfair that Citi cancelled my account, although I have never missed or been late on a payment to them, without some sort of warning. 
I will never use Citi again - for anything - but I find their policy as practiced on me to be anti-consumer and one they should be forced to change or at the least modify.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",AR,727XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,03/03/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3552817

03/07/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"I write to complain about an interest charged on my citibank credit card. It was an offline transaction occurred on XX/XX/2020 in XXXX, XXXX, where I purchased several stamps from XXXX  XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX ). The transaction has been categorized as "" Cash Advance '' by citibank, and I was levied an interest charge because of that. However, to the best of my knowledge, I did not input any PIN into the POS when I made the purchase. 

I contacted citi via online chat, trying to tell them they have miscategorized the transaction, and politely asked them how I can prevent this from happening again. Yet I was informed that I should not proceed with the transaction when I learned the transaction is a "" Cash Advance ''. However, this sounds a little bit ridiculous to me as a customer would never be able to learn whether a transection is a "" Cash Advance '' before it has been posted in the customer 's statement. This becomes a Catch-22 from my perspective. Further, this offline transaction did not require me to key in any PIN number at all, which has made me more concerned. Doesn't this indicate that a bank could authorize "" Cash Advance '' without a PIN number? If so, how would a customer be able to protect herself from her transaction being miscategorized as "" Cash Advance '' and then exposing herself to the high interets and fees levied by the bank in such an ungrounded manner? How could a customer protect her money if a bank could authorize "" Cash Advance '' without a PIN? 

Even though the amount involved is marginal, yet the fault in the system reflected in such case, I belive, does warrant more scrutiny and review. I hope CFPB and citibank could look into this case from a systematic perspective, and at least provide customers an option to prevent such "" Cash Advance '' without a PIN from happening, so that customers could be immune from such arbitrary fees and charges, and their hard-earned dollars could be preserved in a way as customers wish.

I fulfilled all the requirements of the promotion in order to receive XXXX Citibank points in my "" Thank You '' account with Citi. I submitted 16 pages of documentation of this fraud. I just received a response today from Citibank and from the CFPB. Citibank lied to both me and the CFPB that they had in fact deposited XXXX Thank You Points on XX/XX/2020. Here is the response submitted to the CFPB and to me today. 

"" Upon receipt of your concerns we engaged our Senior Management overseeing our promotions. They have confirmed that you were targeted for the promotion code XXXX for XXXX Thank You Points.

Furthermore, Citibank claimed to have even deposited the points 10 days before I even submitted my complaint to the CFPB which is an outright lie. I attached the letter from XX/XX/2020 which Citibank stated I wasn't even eligible for the promotion and therefore was not going to receive the points. 

It is one thing that Citibank apparently hates its customers to defraud them, but it is a whole other problem for Citibank to blatantly lie to the CFPB, its regulator, and lie in it's official response stating the situation is resolved when it is anything but resolved. Astoundingly, Citibank claimed to have resolved the complaint ( on XX/XX/2020 ) before I even filed the complaint on XX/XX/2020. I will likely have to take legal action now as a result of this fraud.

I paid the balance due in full one day late, and Macys was kind enough to reverse the charge. Over the phone I was assured that there would be no balance due and no additional charges on the account. 

After calling to check on the balance ~one week later, I learned that the reversal was not for the full amount, but rather {$28.00} dollars. Seeing as I was partially at fault, I gladly paid the {$2.00} hoping that the issue was resolved. 

The next month I received a bill with an additonal {$2.00} fee to my surprise. This was later explained to me as interest.

The things that changed are listed below : 1. Home Depot and Best Buy continue deceptive marketing of CITI Bank Credit card financing by saying that the financing be it 6 months, 12 months, 18 months or 24 months is NO INTEREST AND NO PAYMENT. I confirmed this as late as this month and when I probed the sales representative he told me that you are only required to pay a minimal amount. 

2. The charge on the closed Home Depot Card was actually for my Kitchen project but I was told that THE FINANCING WAS FOR 6 MONTHS NO INTEREST AND NO PAYMENT. 

3. UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME, THIS PROJECT WAS COMPLETED IN XX/XX/XXXX, AND THIS MONTH WAS THE TIME, MY ONLY SISTER AND FAMILY MEMBER LIVING WITH ME WAS DIAGNOSED WITH XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX. WITH THE DECEPTIVE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY HOME DEPOT, ( PROGRAMMING MYSELF TO PAY THE CHARGE OFF BY SIX MONTHS ), AND RUNNING AROUND TO SAVE MY SISTER 'S, CITI BANK CONTINUED TO PILE DELINQUENT CHARGES ON THAT CARD. MY SISTER FINALLY LOST THE FIGHT FOR HER LIVE IN XXXX OF XXXX. 

4. THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED IN XXXX WITH MY HOME DEPOT CITI BANK CARD ( DECEPTIVE 18 MONTHS NO INTEREST AND NO PAYMENT PROMOTIONAL FINANCING ) HAPPENED AGAIN IN XX/XX/XXXX AND XX/XX/XXXX WITH MY BEST BUY CITI BANK AND HOME DEPOT CITI BANK CREDIT CARDS. THE  DIFFERENCE THIS TIME WAS THAT I WAS NOT CAUGHT UP IN TRYING TO SAVE MY SISTER 'S LIVE AND SECONDLY I FILLED FOR A BUSINESS LINE OF CREDIT, WHICH BROUGHT OUGHT THE DELINQUENT REPORTINGS IN MY CREDIT REPPORT. I HAVE SINCE PAID OFF ALL THE BALANCE IN THE HOME DEPOT CITI BANK CARD AND SET UP A RECURRING MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO THE BEST BUY CITI BANK CARD.

5. NON OF THESE DELINQUENT CHARGES WOULD HAVE NOT OCCURED IF HOME DEPOT CITI BANK SALES REPRESENTATIVE DID NOT USE DECEPTIVE MARKETING OF "" NO INTEREST AND NO PAYMENT FINANCING '' TO LURE ME TO CHARGE THAT AMOUNT ON THE CARD. 

6. I ALSO REALIZED THAT THOSE DELIQUENT REPORTING WERE IN MY ; XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXXANG XX/XX/XXXX CREDIT REPORTS. 

I HEREBY SOUGHT YOUR ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE ABOVE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES TO PURGE ALL DELINQUENT REPORTING ON DATES LISTED IN MY XX/XX/XXXX COMPLAINT FROM MY CREDIT REPORT XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXXAND XX/XX/XXXX ). 

I WILL ALSO URGE CFPB, TO CENSURE HOME DEPOT AND CITI BANK AGAINST FUTURE DECEPTIVE PROMOTIONAL FINANCING Complaint Filled on XXXXis listed below : Good afternoon, My name is XXXX XXXX and I reside in XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, MN XXXX. Email address and telephone number are : XXXX and XXXX respectively. My complaints are with Citi Bank Credit Card ( Through Home Depot ) and another Citi Bank Credit Card ( Through Best Buy ). Citi Bank Credit Card ( Through Home Depot ) AC # : XXXX ; In XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX Citi Bank wrongly placed late payments on my credit reports. I was never away that such information was on my credit report because they were wrong. I happened to apply for line of credit and I was informed of the late payments that was reported in my credit report. They told me that I can obtain a free copy of my credit report. When I did, I discovered that the reporting was through Home Depot who  recently closed that account without notifying me. All the projects I had had with Home Depot in the past was always 24 months, NO INTEREST and NO PAYMENTS and usually I set up a recurring payments from my bank to take care of all the payments before the 24 months due date. I contacted Home Depot credit card who identified themselves as Citi Bank. I immediately informed them of the incorrect reporting by them on my credit report, they offered to send me copies of the invoices because prior to that those invoices were never sent to me. At the time of that request Citi Bank was operation two cards with  Home Depot under my name but shortly after the call, they now refer to that account as closed but no reason was provided to me as to why it was closed and when that took place because as of XX/XX/XXXX, I made purchases at Home Depot with the card. When I finally got the invoices, I contacted Citi Bank to let them know that the information they have on my credit report was wrong and that they should remove those from my report but they said I should contact the credit bureau to have them remove that. I again contacted them today, after noticing the same pattern with a recent transaction with my Best Buy, Citi Bank credit card. This time they told me the account is closed that they will not adjust their reporting. Please this looks like fraud by Citi Bank because the same thing is happening with my Best Buy credit card managed by Citi Bank. On both occasions I was offered 24 months and 18 Months No Interest and No payments. On both occasions my invoices were never mailed and both occasions involved closing my old accounts without notification and sending me new credits cards. Below is what happened with my Best Buy credit card. Best Buy Credit Card ( Through Citi Bank ) Ac # : XXXX : In XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a television from Best Buy and I was told that I was getting 18 months No Interest and No Payment for the purchase. Shortly after that, I received a credit card from Best Buy and since I had a credit card from Best Buy like Home Depot, I did not activate the card. Meanwhile in I set up a  recurring payment to take care of the purchase cost before the 18 months. Suddenly, I started receiving voice mail to go online and review my City Bank - Best Buy credit card. That sounded  strange because the message never mentioned payment due and as long as I know the purchase was No Interest and No payments and more over I have not received any invoice from Best Buy or Citi Bank regarding my purchase. It wasn't until I realized what Citi Bank did to my credit report that I decided to contact them, To my surprise when I contacted them they said my account was overdue and was under collection. At this point I have sent {$200.00} to my Best Buy account which I thought was still current. I told them that they do not know what they are talking about, first I reminded them that my purchase was 18 months No Interest and No Payment and the account can not be overdue. Secondly, I reminded them that I sent {$200.00} to them and another payment of {$200.00} was scheduled to be made by my bank of XX/XX/XXXX. They said they did not receive anything and was trying to get me to make a payment of {$100.00}. At that time I thought I was speaking with fraudsters so I hung up. I then went back to the new card Best Buy sent me which was not activated and called the customer service number listed on that card. When the representative came I narrated everything that has taken place and she said that the purchase was set up for No Interest but monthly payments were required. Then I asked her why they have not sent me any invoice since that purchase, but she could not answer that question. When I enquired about the {$200.00} I sent, she said that they have not received anything from me. At that time I had the information where the {$200.00} was sent in front of me, and that was how I found out that the account like Home Depot credit card was also closed and that the card that was sent to me was my new account. I asked her whether she has access to the old account and she put me on hold and when she came back she said that the {$200.00} was in that old account. It was then that I realized that Citi Bank had accessed two late payment of thirty something dollars the new account. The only thing they told me was that they are sorry that they will wave one of the late payments now and asked me to call them back in XXXX to wave the other one, the reason I was meant to wait to wave the late charge due to their error beats me. As we speak I have not received a single invoice on my Best Buy Citi Bank credit card. THIS CLEARLY LOOKS LIKE FRAUD BY CITY BANK. 1. They first offered No Interest and No Payment before purchase, then they turn around and start charging people late charges and putting ridiculous comments on peoples credit reports and if you are lucky you will detect it on time and sometimes pay additional money to clear your records.

Since I have had the card the company has on an continuous, irregular and spontaneous basis conducted so called "" reviews '' of my account by obtaining copies of my credit report without notice to me and without my permission. Macy 's has used this information to decrease my credit limit from {$2000.00} to {$1900.00} in XX/XX/XXXX and again to decrease my credit limit from {$1900.00} to {$1800.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I was notified by Macy 's that my Macy 's AMX card would not be renewed beyond the expiration date of XX/XX/XXXX even though I have always paid by bill on time and never exceeded my credit limit. The company refuses to reconsider its decision or offer any type of appeals process to its decision. The company also refuses to allow me to close the account and or settle the account for less than the full balance. The company also refuses to remove the information from my credit file with the three major credit bureaus pursuant to 18 USC 1681i and 18 USC 1681s-2 ( b ). I also find it interesting that Macy 's is basing its decision on information from one credit bureau XX/XX/XXXX however, Macy 's is reporting information regarding this account to all three credit bureaus.

The only thing that Macys wants to do is offer and unhelpful, incomplete, generic, and cursory response stating that we are only doing what the Credit Card Agreement allows us to do written by an apathetic, heartless minion automaton. Macys refuses to disclose the qualifications or criteria to obtain or renew or maintain a Macys AMX card. Macys should be required by law to prominently and conspicuously disclose this clause to all applicants including at all Macys stores and point of sale systems.

A growing and popular trend among credit card companies is to frequently pull a credit report on a consumer to "" review '' their account and then lower or decrease the credit limit closer to whatever the balance is on the card at the time of the "" review '' and then complain that the consumer is using too much of the credit limit or that the proportion of balance to credit limit is too high. Then the credit card companies expect the consumer to pay the full balance while at the same time continuing to charge interest on an account the consumer may no longer be able to use and refuse to work with the consumer for an amicable solution. It's only when a corporation is sued or is subject to action taken by the government against the corporation, then the corporation wants to play the victim. At a time when Macy 's is struggling and is going through tough financial times and having to close stores and lay off employee I don't think upsetting and alienating the customers is a way to increase business and sales to help a company that is already struggling financially and prevent Macy 's from following behind Sears in filing bankruptcy and will probably go out of business in the next five years",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",GA,300XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/16/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3567621

It is now XX/XX/XXXX, so my payment is late because I did not know they were not going to comply with the terms of our agreement. I have requested the credit card company to refund the fee as it was because if their actions that my payment was not taken out. They have refused. I have escalated my request, and that too was refused.

I talked to Citi, they just said the category is somehow self supported by the merchants and they can do nothing and refused to give me extra 4 % cash back.

Otherwise why I will use this card to pay for this purchase?

XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, SD XXXX RE : Citi Card Account : xxxx To Whom It May Concern : I am writing to request you to reopen the investigation into my dispute with my AAdvantage Citicard Account Ending xxxx. 
I state that I have not provided the merchant with my account information and that my credit card information was fraudulently used at the merchant ( XXXX XXXX ) location in XXXX, South Carolina. 
This is a case of identity theft that has been perpetrated by individuals with the intent of stealing from the merchant using my identity. I am not responsible for these charges by criminals using my identity. 
As you will note from my record and profile with Citibank, I reside at XXXX, Nebraska and have lived at my current residence since XX/XX/XXXX. I am an employee of XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. 
I was in XXXX, XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX on the day of the fraudulent transactions using my identity. I have not been a member of XXXX XXXX for several years, since XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX my XXXX phone was fraudulently ported to another carrier which I reported to XXXX immediately on the night of XX/XX/XXXX. 
I was assigned a temporary phone number by XXXX, which was also fraudulently ported and XXXX issued another temporary number. It was several days before I received my original number xxxx after placing a porting freeze. 
I then received a letter from Citibank regarding the fraudulent transactions using ID theft at the merchant. I called Citibank immediately after receiving this letter and reported that I had not made these transactions. 
A dispute investigation was opened and Citibank issued a replacement card ending xxxx in place of card ending xxxx. 
Records will indicate that I have not used this card for several months. 
My credit score is above 800 as reported by three consumer reporting agencies. 
Please reopen this dispute investigation into this fraudulent use of my identity for criminal activity at the merchant.

I fulfilled the promotional spending terms of the offer and Citi awarded me those miles. However American Airlines confiscated those miles and terminated my account citing the miles were obtained fraudulent. They cite a 48 month eligibility restriction on getting those miles but no eligibility restriction in the terms and conditions existed nor existed in the application page terms and conditions. They claim Citi had those promotional offer restrictions in the header of the application page but that is false. The imply or insinuate that Citi is the one that is behind this deceptive, unfair and unreasonable action and confiscation. Citi vetted and approved my applications and I fulfilled the terms of their offer therefore this amounts to a deceptive bait and switch. No such 48 month eligibility bonus restriction language existed and this allegation is completely false. 

I am asking for citi to confirm that this 48 month eligibility restriction language did not exist and that earned miles were legitimately earned. Futhermore I would like citi to either provide me with the miles or monetary equivalent and/or compel American Airlines to reinstate my account and miles.

I tried to transfer all the money from my old Citi accounts to the new ones and close the old ones. I called Citi twice and neither representatives could find my old accounts in their system. They told me to go to a branch, but that was not practical because the nearest branch was over 200 miles away in XXXX. The second representative said I could transfer the money by myself and that Citi would close XXXX  balance accounts automatically. I explicitly asked if there would be negative consequences of leaving accounts with XXXX  balance and the representative said no. So I transferred the money. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I found an overdraft notice in my mail pile after being away in XXXX. It turned out Citi charged me a monthly service fee on XX/XX/XXXX, and then an overdraft fee on XX/XX/XXXX. I called Citi right away. The first representative told me to wait while he went to ask his supervisor. Then, I was cut off. I called again. The second representative said my accounts hadn't been closed because {$0.00} ( my savings account interest ) was transferred to my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. Then I was cut off again while waiting for her to close my accounts. I called a third time and told the representative at the beginning that I was cut off twice already. The third representative promised not to hang up and closed my accounts. 
Though my problem was resolved in the end - fees waived and accounts closed, it took me 5 calls and more than an hour on the phone. The whole experience was very unsatisfactory, and it is easy to imagine situations where some clients didn't call or gave up during the process or couldn't get fees waived. 
I don't have complaints against individual representatives even though one give inaccurate information, because I felt they were under pressure from the management to avoid closing accounts.

Sometime in early XXXX, we cancelled our trip through XXXX XXXX. The cancellation stated we would be getting credit back to our credit card ( Citicard ). When the credit didn't come, I logged onto my Citicard and disputed the charges stating that they had been cancelled with the merchant and that the merchant stated I would be getting credit. There were 4 charges, 2 for {$200.00} and 2 charges for {$770.00}, the charges were for each of the flights for myself and my wife. When I disputed with Citi, it only appeared that 2 of the disputes went through, just one of the {$200.00} charges and one of the {$770.00} charges, but not all 4. I used the online chat feature on the Citi website and stated it didn't appear that all 4 charges got disputed. After investigating the Citi Rep stated that they went ahead and completed the other disputes and that they were all now disputed. The Citi Rep stated that I would be getting conditional credit within 2 business days. On XX/XX/XXXX, I found out that I had only received credit for 2 of the charges ( one each of the {$200.00} and {$770.00} ). However, when I look at the transaction detail on the Citi website, it shows me that all 4 are disputed, but then in their "" dispute center '' it only shows 2. I use the chat again to explain that there are still 2 charges for which show disputed but I have not  received credit. The Citi Rep "" XXXX '' states that she only sees 2 disputes. I re-explain the situation and she states that the other 2 "" did not go through completely in the system ''. I question that because I have screenshots of the previous chat where the Citi Rep states they completed the disputes and that I would receive credit within 2 business days. I further ask isn't that a violation because Visa requires credit within 5 business days. She states that "" most disputes provided a credit, but it is not mandatory ''. At this point, I am frustrated as I was assured a month ago I would receive credit and that the disputes were entered into their system. I reiterate that it's not my fault that their system didn't "" complete '' the dispute, that it is their problem and that I have screenshots of the XXXX online chat which confirmed they were done and that I would receive the credit within 2 days. The Citi Rep replies if I have further questions, here 's a phone number. And she ended the chat without even letting me reply anymore. Citi told me the disputes were entered and promised me a credit that was never given. And when I express that I have proof of this promise, the Rep ends the chat. This is so unprofessional. They have held onto my money for over a month. They won't admit their error or provide me with any assurance of when I will get this credit. The people we were traveling with canceled at the same time and they have full - permanent - credit. I have screenshots from their website showing me that all 4 were disputed and I have the screenshots of the Rep from XXXX confirming they were disputed and telling me I would get credit within 2 business days.

On XX/XX/20, I went to the police station to file a report and called Citibank to let them know that I was a victim of a scam and did not authorize the purchase as I was manipulated in doing so and so they opened a case that day. 

On XX/XX/20, they gave me a provisional credit to my account while they investigate the case.

The trades were performed in the State of Nevada ; the first one was in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX office # XXXX as an advance done in visa ATM for {$300.00} ( XXXX XXXX dollars ), some items in XXXX for {$100.00} ( XXXX XXXX dollars ), plus some fees for a total of {$41000.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX cents  ). 
The second was in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX office # XXXX as an advance in Mastercard ATM for {$200.00} ( XXXX XXXX dollars ) and some items ( granola chewy XXXX, stack snack, wipe sensitive for {$32.00} ( XXXX XXXX dollars and XXXX XXXX cents ) plus some fees for XXXX ( XXXX dollars and XXXX XXXX cents ) for a total of {$240.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars and XXXX cents ). 

I live in the state of Florida and on the date that the transactions were done I was in XXXX. 
The same day that I received the statement called Office Depot store customer service, explain that I don't have Office Depot credit card and the lady that answered told me that the card number didn't exist neither in my name nor in the name of my company as it is written in the credit card statement. She gave me a phone number to communicate with Business credit card Office Depot department to clear the situation. 
Today XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  east time, I had communication with them, they recorded the call and the lady told me that in XX/XX/XXXX, I did an application to get a Credit card, but I never received the card and really I never asked for it. Is more the card is a business card but is not there on the statement the complete name of my company. She requested the complete name of my company and the address to start an investigation. That could mean that she didn't have my information. 

In conclusion the statement is a fake notice, I never had a credit card from Office Depot store, I live in Florida and there is not any possibility that I could have done the transactions made in XXXX XX/XX/XXXX in the State of Nevada. I hope you can help to resolve this problem.

Travel authorization was documented in the XXXX XXXX XXXX and a charge of XXXX was authorized for commercial flight through XXXX XXXX. Records on the card of record indicate that an additional charge of XXXX was made on the same day and without authorization through the same travel agency and commercial airline. No record of this approved charge was made on any of the Department of Defense channels and the charge was erroneous and fraudulent in nature. 

Upon return to XXXX, a voucher was settled for the approved amount of XXXX and I completed my XXXX overseas. Upon my return to the United States, I found several letters sent to my physical address stating that an outstanding balance of XXXX was overdue. As the credit card of use was a Citi Bank XXXX   XXXX Card, no charges outside of those approved through the XXXX XXXX XXXX should have been processed. I contacted citi bank and they verified that a duplicate charge from XXXX XXXX was made on the card the same day the original charge was made - however they were unable to state how the charge was made if there was no authorization made by the government. Upon identifying the erroneous charge as fraudulent, I opened a claim with Citi Bank on XX/XX/XXXX and received verbal verification that they would investigate the claim and provide me a conditional credit. Citi Bank did verify my contact information on file and stated they would contact me directly if they needed any additional information to verify the charge was unauthorized. 

I did not receive ANY further communication between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX concerning this claim. No emails, phone calls or physical correspondence were received during the period of "" investigation ''. 

On or around XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Citi Bank stating that I now had an outstanding balance for XXXX+ overdue 60 days.

I asked what methods and or dates they used to get a hold of me and they were unable to answer - they simply stated that the case was closed and the balance was due. 

I contacted Citi Bank once again the following day and requested evidence that they had attempted to contact me and none was provided. I was informed that since they were unable to get a "" refund '' for the unauthorized charge, that I was now responsible for the balance and that I could not appeal the decision. 

I have all records of the approved expenses on file from the government and none were ever asked of me. The erroneous charge was made from an overseas travel agency that did not respond to citi banks requests for information and as such Citi Bank stated that I was responsible for the charge.

On a recorded line a Citi authorized agent agreed to refund the annual fee due to poor service and lack of transparency. I must note again the event was via a recorded line! In addition they failed to adequately service a co-branded card, which had a legal dispute ... resolved confidentially via the merchant and I. As a 13 year Citi Gold customer I am disgusted they will not let me downgrade or close my Citi Prestige card via online or telephone ( I want a product conversion as a closure would lower my credit score ). They want me to write in to South Dakota during COVID-19 putting myself and family at risk to get stamps at the post office ( unnecessary when staff is encouraged to work from home ). I am outraged that they hold my deposits and three credit cards and charge me an annual fee of {$490.00} for a travel card when travel is essentially restricted to essential work not leisure. Citi should be investigated for putting their premium customers at unnecessary risk during these uncertain times in an attempt to mask their poorly trained staff 's lack of basic service. I think I have a right to challenge a top 4 US bank if they lie and try to cheat a customer ... after taking billions in tax dollars in a bail out.

I made a promotional purchase that, due to unforeseen issues, I was not able to pay in full within the timeframe. So when it expired, all accrued interest was added to the account, making to balance go over the credit limit. Instead of doing like most credit cards, blocking the card until balance goes below the limit over a period of time while accruing interest, they make the full overage amount plus principle due on the next payment. My payment went from {$150.00} a month to {$1200.00}. There is no where in the disclosure that says that will happen and is Unfair, Deceptive, and Abusive practice. Furthermore, it completely goes against the Fair Lending laws, in which no cost of debt is provided. I entered a settlement with Citibank to pay the card off in XX/XX/2020. However, COVID19 hit, my wife lost her job and I lost half of my income. I ask to extend the payoff, and the manager says that due to fair lending, they can not. Fair lending has NOTHING to do with a nationally declared pandemic. There is no reason they can not extend the terms of the settlement. I need to feed my family. There is absolutely no reason that Citibank can not postpone the settlement payment at least a month or two. That does not, in any way, violate any fair lending laws. In fact, quite the opposite. Instead they want to be greedy. They could never, to this date produce an accurate statement, regardless of how many times I asked.

04/14/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"I have a Citi Double Cash mastercard. Per Citi, the interest rate for purchases is 15.995 %. I mistakenly underpaid my XXXX statement by {$20.00}. I was charged {$22.00} in interest for this {$20.00} mistake on my XXXX statement. I called Citi to ask about the {$22.00} interest charge and they pointed out my {$20.00} mistake and agreed to remove the interest charge. I also then immediately paid {$100.00} to the Citi account to cover the {$20.00} shortage, and to make sure that any interest would stop accruing. I also paid my XXXX statement in full a week later ( before the due date ), then also received a vendor refund for {$210.00} before the XXXX statement due date, effectively meaning that my credit card account was overpaid ( i.e. the combination of my payments and vendor refunds was more than I owed to Citi. ) Yet, in my XXXX card statement, Citi charged another {$63.00} in interest charges. Citi representatives say that this is additional interest accruing on the {$20.00} underpayment from XXXX ; the representative says that even if the account is paid in full, Citi continues to charge interest for at least two additional months!. Citi refused to remove this interest charge. By my math, the two interest charges amount to more than a 2,500 % interest rate on the {$20.00} underpayment ( vs the purported 15.995 %, plus Citi 's initial claim that they would remove the interest from my account as I made a small mistake. ) It is criminal and/or unethical that Citi 's interest charges amount to >2,500 % annual rates, and that Citi continues to accrue interest for at least two months even after the account is paid in full!",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",DE,None,None,Consent provided,Web,04/14/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3606343

The transaction was authorized by me for the amount of XXXX $ for a watch. 
XXXX order number is XXXX and it was sold by XXXX id XXXX and title of the item is XXXX XXXX Submariner Ceramic Two Tone XXXX XXXX Dial XXXX Men 's Watch. The XXXX   item number is XXXX XXXX date of XX/XX/XXXX. 
I paid using my Attuniversal card via XXXX. I never received my item from the seller. The tracking number they provided shows clearly the item was sent somewhere else and signed for by someone but not to my physical address. I never recieved anything at my address and nor did i sign for anything and believe it is fraud. The seller never responded. 
The seller never responded to numerous emails that I sent via XXXX. It was then i contacted ATTUniversal card. The person who took my call must have misunderstood me and opened a case of fraudulent charge that i did not authorize. But I did authorize the charge but I never recieved the item. 
I even called the next day and spoke to another agent at ATTuniversal and they said that I did a good thing of calling as the case only showed that a fraudulent charge was made. 
The agent stated that he was able to add notes to the current case and that things should resolve soon. Sadly, that is not what happened. I was never contacted about anything in regards to the situation by ATTuniversl citi cards. I simply got a Letter via online that stated against me but was a little confusing. So i called ATTuniversal again and they said nothing to worry, they have agreed in my favor. i was relieved to hear that. But later, i saw the charge was added to my billing in the amount of XXXX . Clearly there has been a mistake. I have already contacted ATTuniversal Citi and also XXXX. They have stated that the case is ongoing but what I do not see that anywhere on my acct on ATTuniversal citi nor XXXX but i was told the case is open and the merchant has been contacted. I must have made about 30 calls to XXXX and attuniversal citi cards regarding this matter. They should have a record of all calls and also recordings. 

If you simply look at the tracking the Seller has provided, you will see that the item never was sent to me. It is a XXXX tracking number of XXXX that the seller provided to XXXX. When i clicked on it, it showed the item was already delivered and signed for on XX/XX/XXXX ... .that is before I even bought the item!. 
The XXXX listing is XX/XX/XXXX but delivery shows XX/XX/XXXX? to XXXX XXXX, XXXX .... I am in XXXX. not in XXXX. Once again, item bought XX/XX/XXXX but delivered XX/XX/XXXX? how can that be? and delivered to XXXX  where the item was supposedly coming from. I am in XXXX  my whole life. 
I have copies of all that i could gather to show proof of the fraud that this seller has done. I even mailed it to the Citi cards via certified mail and also to XXXX but to no avail did I get a response. I am so disappointed about how long this is taking but i believe once the respected merchant see 's this, they will conclude what has taken place. Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you asap to close the matter. I have been a faithful citi card customer and XXXX customer for years. thank you for hearing my plea and request.

I withdrew all of XXXX disputes for the year when accusations were made by XXXX in the executive office that I made mispresented at least two of their disputes in recent months. All of these disputes were given to me as permanent credits with no additional documentation required. Despite issuing me permanent credits, Citibank was also paying XXXX for numerous disputes and then just writing the amounts off according to XXXX. 

I decided to take the problems directly up with XXXX  due to all the problems I have had with them in recent years. I have asked billing disputes for all dispute information including the merchants response. To date, they have only responded on 3 of the disputes : XXXX for {$26.00} for XX/XX/XXXX ( was told on XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX XXXX by XXXX in billing disputes that Citibank did not pay XXXX  for the dispute which is why the system would not withdraw it ) ; and XXXX for {$5.00} date XX/XX/XXXX ( I withdrew the dispute, Citibank sent a letter stating they did not pay the merchant and the account would not be rebilled, yet a rebilling appeared on my transaction history shortly after. The CFCB has another open case on this one, reference XXXX with uploaded documents ) ; and XXXX for {$8.00} dated XX/XX/XXXX ( there is also another CFPB report open on this one due to how they mishandled it, reference XXXX with uploaded documents, although I will admit I forgot to withdraw it once I received reimbursement for the lost items in the package with the postal service. The dispute clearly states I had filed a claim. Citibank should have asked me for further documentation which would have triggered me to eventually withdraw it once I realized I was also being compensated beyond the lost items in the package ). 

I am still waiting on documentation for dispute XXXX. The amount was for {$7.00} dated XX/XX/XXXX due to a lost priority mail package. I believe this one was probably handled similar to dispute XXXX. A tracking number would have clearly been listed in the dispute, Citibank could have easily pulled up USPS tracking history to verify it was lost, which means it did indeed qualify under goods/services not as provided. XXXX lists on their receipts that they are a post office. All of these disputes were issued permanent credit with no documentation required. 

I am still waiting on documentation for dispute XXXX. The disputed amount is for {$35.00} and dates to XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX  has recently reimbursed me for mispricing through their meat department and well as failing to process returns properly.

I have e-mail correspondence from the district manager that agrees to reimburse {$150.00} for all the problems, which is above and beyond the disputed amounts ). Citibank issued me a permanent credit with no additional documentation as well as paying the XXXX. They reversed the charge at my request only.

04/16/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Hello, I am trying to dispute charges on 2 Citi credit cards and having difficulty with both. The transaction date was XX/XX/XXXX in the amounts of {$8500.00} and {$5000.00} by XXXX XXXX XXXX. The merchant is shut down by the Federal Trade Commission and what was purchased was a commitment for the merchant to work with me until succeeding and earning what I have invested in the commitment. As soon as purchasing, I did not receive access to what was promised and learned the company was being investigated and shut down. I have provided Citi with loads of information including contracts, Court documents of the case, second-opinion letters, etc. I started both disputes in XX/XX/XXXX and now it is XX/XX/XXXX and things are still unresolved. I have tried to contact the merchant multiple times and they are not reachable as I have told that to Citibank as well. I have been keeping track of the disputes and the Citi representative that helped me the first time filed it as fraud instead of billing dispute which held things back and I had to file a dispute again for the second time on both accounts. Citi emailed me stating they have received a response from the merchant, which the merchant is not allowed to respond to any bank as they are shut down and due to Court orders. I have stated this to Citi and it seems like they don't care. I call Citi regularly and can never reach anyone and if I do the responses are always different. Over the course of the past few months, Citi has now said the disputes are resolved in the merchant 's favor and provided no documentation or reasoning behind it to me. I refiled the two disputes on XX/XX/XXXX and they were already resolved in a matter of a few days, again in the merchant 's favor without any reasoning. I have requested documentation to see what the merchant or merchant 's bank has sent to Citi and Citi is failing to provide that. I have requested call backs from supervisors, emails and letters of documentation and have not received any of those. I paid for a commitment to be held and it is broken by the merchant due to their fraudulent claims and promises. I am now left with a lot of debt from Citi and they want me to pay it even though I am not receiving any services from the merchant. I believe they are going against my rights as a consumer. Also, I charged this commitment on multiple credit cards with banks such as XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX and they have reimbursed me without any headaches and problems. Citi is the only bank I am having problems with and I have provided multiple documents of proof to only be left with no answers. I have called, emailed, faxed, and mailed documents to Citi -- at this point I am unsure an investigation of both charges/disputes were even conducted.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",TX,775XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/16/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3609421

02/08/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"This is regarding several billing disputes that Citibank accused me of misrepresenting. The executive office employee that made these accusations was XXXX, and it occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. The call was recorded for quality assurance purposes, so I am asking that the CFPB request the call record. 

During this phone call, I had misrepresented several billing disputes and gave me a few examples : XXXX Store : Home Depot Purchase Date : XX/XX/XXXX Dispute Date : XX/XX/XXXX Permanent Credit Applied : XX/XX/XXXXPurchase : Two bags of lime Reason for return and dispute : one lime bag was torn and the other was water damaged ( torn contents got all over my car and was unable to apply the wet lime to our spreader ) Accusation : XXXX stated Home Depot claimed I never attempted to return the items. XXXX stated the items never were damaged, the bag did not leak in my car, I never attempted to call the store to complain despite telling her I was sure I could provide a phone record of the call. She implied I lied. 
Home Depot 's response : E-mailed and spoke to the general manager of the store, XXXX XXXX. He stated corporate office handles disputes and they only send him receipts to inquire if he agrees or disagrees. XXXX the store never could have confirmed whether I called or not. I sent him a copy of my phone records. He confirmed the call was made following the time stamp on the receipt and conceeded I must have complained and the return was not properly processed. Home Depot has offered to refund the account, but it is now well outside the dispute period. I proactively approached them on another previous dispute over XXXX 's seed ( this was not mentioned by XXXX ),  because I decided to just contacting merchants based on the little amount of documentation I was given. They agreed to refund this as well, because their website advertising for XXXX 's shows a different return policy than their store ( 90 days ). The XXXX  is involved in this complaint. 
Main problem : Citibank issued permanent credits to me on both disputes with no additional documentation required but also paid Home Depot on both transactions. In addition, XXXX stated they just wrote the {$10.00} off. She chalked it up to the dollar amount. But the seed purchase was over $ XXXX.The dispute number on the seed purchase is XXXX. 
Documentation sent : XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX Store : XXXX XXXX Purchase date : XX/XX/XXXX Dispute date : XX/XX/XXXX Permanent credit applied : No longer can access the date through Citibank 's  website because I withdrew the dispute to proactively resolve it with the merchant due to prior mistakes. They did send me documentation by e-mail stating they issued a permanent credit with no additional documentation required. Letters through Citibank 's notification 's page have disappeared, despite saying a 12-month history will be listed from the date made available, so I can not compare dates. 
Purchase : XXXX Reason for dispute : XXXX was not made properly. When a customer orders, they order at the cash register and then wait for the food or take it home to go. If something is wrong, a manager will refund in-store or over the phone based on receipt information. They do not ask you for the card. Refund was not processed properly.

Accusation : XXXX stated I never tried to return the item and implied because I tipped there was obviously nothing wrong with the pizza. I told her I had also complained frequently through their website on orders and she said I had not. 
XXXX  's response : This problem was address with XXXX XXXX, their assistant manager, and XXXX XXXX, their financial operations manager. XXXX confirmed a previous recent complaint on their website. XXXX apologized for failing to issue two credits ( I went back to a prior dispute as well to be proactive ). Both charges have been refunded to my credit card as of XX/XX/XXXX, and the dollar amounts exceed the amounts disputed. 
Main problem : Citibank issued permanent credits to me on both disputes with no additional documentation required but also paid XXXX  on both transactions. They also coded the disputes incorrectly as defective merchandise when I clearly disputed them as goods not as received or expected. A pizza can not be defective. In addition, XXXX stated they just wrote the {$18.00} off. She chalked it up to the dollar amount. But the other dispute was $ XXXX.The dispute number on this purchase is XXXX. 
Documentation sent : XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX, XXXX Store : XXXX Purchase dates : Dispute dates : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX Permanent credit applied : No longer can access the date through Citibank 's website because I withdrew all the disputes for the year to proactively resolve it with the merchant due to prior false advertising problems, produce problems, and other problems within the store. They did send me documentation by e-mail stating they issued a permanent credit with no additional documentation required. Letters through Citibank 's notification 's page have disappeared, despite saying a 12-month history will be listed from the date made available, so I can not compare dates. 
Purchases : From as much as I was told, and from the amounts, items from the meat department Reason for dispute : False advertising and items not refunded properly. 
Accusation : XXXX stated I never tried to return the items in an accusatory tone and said one of the amounts disputed didn't even match the receipt. Maybe sales tax wasn't properly calculated? I have no idea because they have failed to send any type of follow up requests to me for additional documentation. 
XXXX 's response : I have been trying to get the problems resolved by e-mail for the last two weeks. On XX/XX/XXXX, I documented by phone how they are mislabeling items in the meat department. I have been talking to their district manager, XXXX XXXX, and he is refunding me for the withdrawn disputes that Citibank has rebilled. These are disputes XXXX for {$35.00}, XXXX XXXX for {$4.00}, XXXX for {$3.00}, and XXXX for {$20.00}. I am still waiting to hear from Citibank on withdraw XXXX for {$26.00}. Despite attempting to withdraw the dispute numerous times, the system will not allow me to do so. I have e-mailed billing disputes three times from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I have received no acknowledgement by e-mail stating they will not withdraw the dispute, so I have no idea if XXXX was paid or not on this transaction. I have also filed an attorney general report against XXXX for false advertising. 
Main problem : Citibank issued permanent credits to me on all disputes with no additional documentation required but also paid XXXX. They only reversed several of them when withdrawn. In addition, XXXX stated they just wrote the {$20.00} and the {$35.00} off. She chalked it up to the dollar amount like on the other purchases. 
Documentation sent : XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX. 

Finally, XXXX stated I would not receive my rewards ' dollars. I stated it was nowhere in my agreement and said I had ordered my agreement online. She told me to go to XXXX 's website. Citibank is responsible for getting customer 's their agreement by mail. They sent out the wrong one. The one they sent doesn't even match my rate. 

Citibank needs to address XXXX 's behavior and they also need to start properly following up on disputes when a merchant doesn't agree with what the customer is saying. I know Citibank is capable of it, because they have done it on other disputes despite the dollar amounts in question. They don't have a consistent policy. XXXX also says there have been problems on other disputes, but Citibank has failed to address these in writing or over the phone and has issued permanent credits with no additional documentation in my favor. I have been proactively going through my dispute history to try to figure out what is going on. I'll further say it is grossly unfair to level this kind of accusation on items outside of the 60-90 day dispute period, giving little details, and just asking a customer to be proactive.

02/19/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers",Didn't receive advertised or promotional terms,"We purchased a kitchen suite for {$4000.00} from XXXX. Like many Costco customers, we decided to buy it from Costco only because Costco promised that they offer a total of 4 year warranty including 1 year from manufacture, 1 year extended by Costco, and 2 year from Citi Card with which we pay for the purchase. One of this suite , dishwasher, had problems very shortly after we got it. We contacted Costco and had repair service twice and the whole dishwasher replaced once, all covered by XXXX warranty. We got very frustrated by the poor quality of this product but was still patient enough to keep using it for a while as we thought we had extended warranty to cover possible product problems. The problem unfortunately happened again some time last XXXX, the dishwasher stopped working completely. We did a lot of internet research trying to figure out what is wrong with it and tried to fix it. But all our effort failed even though we tried different ways. We than contacted Costco for return or repair that was declared by Costco as their extended warranty and 100 % satisfactory guarantee. Since we didn't contact them soon enough to catch the two year warranty by Costco because we were trying to fix it, we were told by Costco to contact Citi Card for extended warranty coverage. We had peace in mind as we had experience with extended  warranty services from XXXX XXXX multiple times on various products purchased from Costco. But to our great surprise, Citi Card even didn't bothered to contact us for details but simply denied our warranty request with only one sentence we had never heard about. It said in their letter, "" As the product has a product defect, no coverage can be provided ''. We checked original warranty from XXXX and it clearly states that XXXX cover all the manufacture defects. Costco openly declare Citi Card extends original warranty for another two years. What don't know what Citi Card 's warranty extends and covers if product defect is not covered? This is obviously a violation of Federal Warranty law with a clear intention of taking advantages of consumer 's lack of protection resources. We then contacted Citi Card on XX/XX/2020 for their explanation of their unclear, ambiguous rules on coverage. I talked to a few representatives including a manager on a few calls for a few hours. But I was denied for coverage by all of them using this unclear statement. This is a very unprofessional, unethical and irresponsible business practice I have never had with all other merchants and extended warranty service provider for decades. They obviously use and manipulate fine prints to deny their warranty obligation at their will. At my second effort, I contacted Costco for help. I called a few times talked with a few people from different departments. To my surprise again. Costco refused to help me with this problem with Citi Card. Costco asked me to handle this difficult problem by myself with Citi Card. This is a very irresponsible business practice. It was Costco 's promise of 4 year warranty that mislead us in making the uninformed purchase decision for Costco product. Costco didn't inform us that the so called extended warranty actually won't cover manufacturer defects and what this extended warranty will cover in detailed and clear statements. We don't understand what this warranty by Citi Card really extends. It was a lye. It was not a warranty at all. Costco used that fancy statement of 4 year warranty to expand their business by tracking customers to make purchase at Costco but refuse to help their customer for their protection right.

After I opened my two additional accounts online, I contacted Citi via phone to request debit cards for those two new accounts, and was advised by the representative on the phone that he linked my two new accounts to my current atm card, so I had three accounts and one debit card. 
Today I went to the at XXXX, CA branch to request separate cards for my accounts, and spoke to a teller named XXXX XXXX, who told me that I needed to call the 800 number on the back of the card to request my debit cards.

I then made an atm cash deposit in the amount of {$60.00} and had the choice of depositing on one of the  three accounts liked to my debit card. 
A few minutes later I contacted the 800 number to request the atm cards for my two new additional checking accounts and was told by the first representative that I only had one additional account. I was then transferred from representative to representative several times until I reached a representative named XXXX XXXX. I asked to speak to a manager but every single representative refused to transfer me to a manager, and Mr. XXXX assured me that he would be able to assist me. By the end of our phone conversation, Mr. XXXX told me that he had a debit card on the way and although there was a {$6.00} fee for rush mailing, he was going to waive that fee and rush the card for my new account. A few minutes later when I tried to access my accounts through the app, I kept receiving an error message, so I contacted Citi again and was told that there was no accounts under my name or social security number and the last four digits of my atm card were invalid. I then spoke with another number of representatives and decided to go back to the branch to withdrawal my available funds, since they were advising me that I didn't have any account with Citi. I went to the same teller and she said she remembered me going to the branch earlier to request atm cards for my new accounts and told me, sorry I was busy when you came earlier. I remembered then that when I went to that branch at XXXX, I was the only customer at the branch and XXXX XXXX was just  sitting there. She processed my withdrawal and asked twice me to return to the branch to resolve the issue of not being able to access my account online and I told her that I wasn't able to return to the branch, so I just wanted to withdraw my available funds. 
Later on I contacted Citi again to sort out all the mess that happened to my account between XXXX XXXX at the branch refusing to providing me with the atm cards for my new accounts and the phone representative who ordered a new card as a replacement to my current card instead of new crads for the new accounts only, and shutting off my online access to my accounts, and was advised by a representative named XXXX that indeed the phone representative sent me a replacement card, instead new cards to my new accounts.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,920XX,None,Consent provided,Web,01/29/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3514098

d with 24 hrs and citi bank failed to stop or notify me of any of these unusual activity When I filed a dispute for these charges, citibank denied this claim after reviewing for few weeks without any reason stated.

 XXXX I am writing this this letter to you with a great disappointment regarding this case. 
Today after contacting the dispute dept they advised me that you are the assigned investigator on this case and have determined that these are not fraudulent and but valid charges made by me.

These are the charges that were made at the following merchants ;  XXXX, XXXX, Home depot and XXXX XXXX  I would like to know that how did you determine the charges were made by me. I have not ever shopped at these merchants for such a large amount. These charges were made within few days which is very unusual Citibank should have contacted me right away and put a stop to these charges because this is not a regular pattern of the charges. They failed to take this action which resulted in all these fraudulent charges. 
I also demand the following : a ) Did the merchant verify my ID before the charges were approved -- Need report on this. 
b ) Do you have the signature receipts from the merchants for the purchases. I am sure these would not be my signatures. 
c ) Do you have video surveillance from the merchant which shows that who is making this purchase. 
There is no explanation that why this claim was denied and this is very appalling response from Citibank.

05/27/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with balance transfer,"In XX/XX/2020, I opened a Citi XXXX Preferred Credit Card with Citi. 
On XX/XX/2020 I requested a balance transfer to pay an existing balance of {$2700.00} on my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Card. 

On XX/XX/2020, the balance transfer amount of {$2700.00} posted on the Citi bank account, but the payment for the balance on the XXXX XXXX credit card account had not been received by XXXX. My credit card statements confirmed XXXX had not received payment. 

On XX/XX/2020, the balance transfer fee of {$130.00} posted on my Citi account. At this point, XXXX still had not received payment from Citi, once again my credit card statements confirmed that XXXX had not received payment. 

On XX/XX/2020, I opened an investigation because XXXX still had not received the {$2700.00} payment for the balance transfer. I asked for the check to be investigated by Citi, since XXXX had no records of having received the check that Citi claimed to have sent to XXXX. 

On XX/XX/2020 Citi sent me a letter with regards to the inquiry into the check sent to XXXX. The check number is XXXX. Citi sent me a copy of the check and asked me to contact XXXX XXXX for additional questions. Citi claimed that the copy of the check is proof of payment. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX again to have them research the check # XXXX and they did not find any evidence in their system that the check sent from Citi was negotiated with XXXX. 

Upon investigating the details of the check copy, I found that the check had an electronic endorsement from XXXX  XXXX XXXX. I called Citi bank back to ask further questions about the details of the check and the electronic endorsement from XXXX  XXXX XXXX. After speaking to several account specialists, and a manager, Citi could not tell me why XXXX XXXX XXXX had endorsed the check. They urged me to contact XXXX about the whereabouts of the check and would not provide any further assistance. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to a XXXX  XXXX  XXXX branch in XXXX, CA on XXXX XXXX and spoke to a regional manager named XXXX. She was able to locate internal records within XXXX  XXXX XXXX that proved XXXX  had received the funds from Citi on XX/XX/2020, but since XXXX  XXXX XXXX did not know which account to deposit the payment, they claimed to have returned the funds to Citi on XX/XX/2020. ( Once again, XXXX holds my XXXX XXXX credit card, not XXXX  XXXX XXXX. ) Still on XX/XX/2020, I then went to a Citi branch in XXXX, CA on XXXX XXXX and asked for help. With documents in hand showing that Citi sent the balance transfer amount to XXXX  XXXX XXXX, instead of XXXX XXXX, branch members communicated with Citi customer service representative on my behalf but were told that nothing could be done because Citi records showed that the check had been deposited and were not willing to accept the confirmation that XXXX had provided me with that showed Citi wrongfully sent the check to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I returned to the same XXXX  XXXX XXXX branch where XXXX and XXXX XXXX helped me open a commit case to investigate the location of the funds. 

On XX/XX/2020 I received a letter from XXXX  XXXX XXXX that asked me to contact Citi directly. 

I called Citi on XX/XX/2020 and asked to speak with an account specialist who could escalate my concern. I explained that I still owed the balance to Citi for the balance transfer plus the balance transfer fee, but XXXX still had not received any form of payment from Citi to credit the XXXX  Credit Card balance. I notified him that Citi had wrongfully sent the funds to XXXX XXXX XXXX instead of XXXX XXXX. I spoke to an account specialist who ensured me that Citi had found records indicating that they did in fact send the check/funds to the wrong bank. He notified me that my Citi account would be credited for the balance transfer amount, as well as credited for the balance transfer fee. Citi would investigate, and I would receive credits on my account. 

On XX/XX/2020 Citi sent a letter which I received on XX/XX/2020. The letter from Citi stated that Citibank did not initiate anything with XXXX XXXX XXXX on my behalf. The letter stated that I needed to contact XXXX XXXX to ensure my payment was listed for {$2700.00} from Citi. I called Citi again to ask when I would see the credits post on my account. The account specialists claimed that no formal investigation had been opened and the investigation would need to be opened again on the whereabouts of the funds. I asked for Citi to cancel the balance transfer and retract the funds and I do not want to try to resend the check for the balance transfer to XXXX XXXX anymore.

01/31/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Privacy issues,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my new Citi credit card had been shut down due to "" suspicious activity ''. Given that the start of the card timed with a string of quick buys on XXXX XXXX   during a video gaming event, I understood and called the company in good humor. In the below information, I have put an asterix ( * ) ahead of my major concerns as there are many issues that occurred. 

In order to confirm there was no fraud taking place, Citi asked me to give them a phone number to verify my identity. I provided them with the number on the account. This is the only phone number on the account, as it is the only phone number I have had since XXXX. I was notified by Citi 's fraud department that they could not use this number to verify my identity because my name was not on the account for the phone. I am on a family business plan. When I asked the relevancy of this information given that I was providing the number on the account ( which they confirmed ), they stated that it was policy that the number used to identify the card member had to be in the card member 's name regardless if the number was on the account or not. The City fraud department then requested that I provide another number to use to verify my account. 

*As stated, there are no other phone numbers associated with the account, nor do I have another phone number - or even one that would be associated with my name if they're doing a check like that. Here I would like to express concerns that they're doing checks on phone line ownership. The status of the ownership of my phone line does not impact the fact that it is the only phone number associated with the account and the only one they should be using in contact with me. 

Once it was clarified to the representative that I do not have another phone line, the representative said that they would like to try something and put me on hold. After several minutes, they notified me that they tried another number and did not reach me. This was obvious to me as my phone was the only one in the home ( no landline ) at the time of the call. 

*They stated that they called a number associated with my name, confirming that it was not associated with the account I had created with them, and had reached my grandmother, notifying that they were calling from the Citi Fraud Department and telling her that there was an issue with my card. At that time, I was then required to disengage from the Citi call to discuss with my grandmother, whom I have not lived with since XX/XX/XXXX and has never had any control or interaction with my banking information, my financial situation. 

*After several minutes, I called Citi back and reached a new associate. When I asked where they retrieved my grandmother 's phone number from, I was notified that Citi uses public records to search and confirm account holder information. 

Once I had confirmed with the representative that there was no other way to verify my identity except through an associated phone line or to wait for Citi to mail me a confirmation number, I was additionally notified that it would also not be possible to close the account until these steps were taken. I requested to be escalated to a manager so that we could flag the account for closure and proceed as quickly as possible as I no longer trusted Citi with my personal information. I was notified that managers were not available at this time and would call me back as soon as they were available. 

At XXXX EST, Citi called me with two back to back phone calls overriding my "" do not disturb '' phone setting ( waking me up ) and left an automated message. 

Citi has since made no further steps to resolve the situation. At this time, I have no intention of unlocking the fraud lock on the card except to close the account, as I prefer it not to be used again.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,112XX,None,Consent provided,Web,01/31/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3515746

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- BACKGROUND ( SUMMARIZED ) Citi practically stole my savings account for 63 days by freezing it without my consent. I had no access to it and was provided no useful information or was offered a real way to resolve the issue. In over at least 15 phone calls, correspondence, and complaints, I hit dead ends for all of them. 

As a result, I suffered a monetary loss in the amount of {$600.00}, the opportunity to earn interest in the amount of {$300.00} ( by putting it in a higher interest account ), and I have lost HOURS of time in making multiple calls and writing correspondence that Citi does not seem to take seriously. In addition, my account was terminated without cause. I am looking to be compensated for my monetary and time loss stated above. 

I am suspecting illegal asset freeze ( see other similar complaints in XXXX  and CFPB by other customers ). For the unexplained account closure, I am suspecting discrimination. 

For more detailed background, I have provided comprehensive explanations and complaints here : CFPB complaint # XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ; XXXX  complaint # XXXX, XXXX. 

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- MY MESSAGE TO CITI I have maintained a professional attitude in my past correspondence, but this is just ridiculous. Your latest response is downright disingenuous. I am appalled at how it clearly shows that you have chosen to ignore my MULTIPLE EXTENSIVE explanations and responses that I took time writing through multiple channels ( XXXX, CFPB, and CERU ). 

By continuing to provide generic and impersonal responses, I feel that instead of trying to resolve the issue of your victimized customer, you are just trying to tire me out hoping to make the problem go away. 

Let me address the content of your latest response on each point : "" First and foremost, please be advised that under no circumstances does Citibank condone any behavior or practice which discriminates against anyone on the basis of any physical or personal criteria, such as race, XXXX, national origin, gender, religion or XXXX orientation. While we understand that you feel you were not provided an adequate level of service, upon our review, we found no evidence to support your claim of unlawful discrimination on the part of our policy. '' Nice legal template words but you have not provided me with an explanation of otherwise.

They all pretty much said, "" Sorry we can't help you. We can not even reach the 'back office ' that processes your case ''. FYI, I have called the number multiple times even before you provided it to me. 

Please refer to my previous explanations here. You have access to all of these. Next time check them up before responding : - CFPB complaint # XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a Citi Accelerated Savings account on line and deposited {$88000.00} from my XXXX XXXX account.

On XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, I added more funds to my account. In mid XXXX I could no longer access my account on Citi 's website.

I asked why and Citi told me I would know from reading the letter. Citi even called XXXX XXXX with me on the phone to verify that the money was mine. 
XXXX XXXX told Citi that it was my money. Additionally, Citi froze my funds so I could not get my money out of my account. Citi told me I would get a letter with the details. It has been 4 months and I never received such a letter. I called Citi repeatedly since XX/XX/XXXX and they tell me to wait for the letter. Again it has been over 4 months. Everytime I ask Citi they tell me to wait for the letter. They give me the same information every time and I get no where. They are brushing me off.

All I want is my money and the amount as of XX/XX/XXXX is {$120000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX my money was no longer in my account. {$120000.00} was withdrawed by Citi and I have not received a check for the funds.

In the letter it states that Citi rescinded the closure of my account and that my account is in a normal status and the funds have been credited back to my account. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a new debit card in the mail. I tried to activate my card and register on line as well. I was on the phone with Citi for an hour and 46 minutes. They told me the letter is wrong, it was sent out in error and I would get a check by mail. I wanted to speak to someone about this and they rep. said the department, which is the returned check department, would not speak to me. The representative said I am relaying a message to you and that is I will get a check in the mail and my account will never be opened. They told me about getting a letter for 4 months and I am asking you for help because I have never received the letter Citi is talking about with a check. I am being treated unfairly. I never got an apology from Citi. All I want is my {$120000.00} that is due me from my savings account that Citi closed.

No explanation.

No reply to my email. 
I understand Citi is allowed to do this to me. That is my complaint - that they are allowed to cause real harm to me by vanishing my safety-net - without justification or explanation. My credit score at the time was approximately 800. There was absolutely no justification or cause. They apparently profiled me and somehow learned I was sick, I am thinking is a real possibility of why they did this - which is in violation of some disabilities law.

I stated Citibank removed the option to order it online. And I further told him dispute notifications had also vanished, although I managed to download some of them before it happened.

On XX/XX/2020, I called Citibanks 800 number. I talked to XXXX. I asked XXXX for a copy of my card member agreement electronically and by mail. XXXX stated it would appear in the Notifications and Letters page within 24 hours. I received an e-mail notification alert saying it was there. I logged onto the Citibank website and there was nothing there On XX/XX/2020, I talked to XXXX in customer service. I asked her for another cardholder agreement and explained the problem with e-mail notifications and that nothing was appearing on the Notifications and Letters page. XXXX said I have been the 2nd or 3rd person to complain to her in the last week about the problem, and all the people that had complained before had dispute notifications disappearing. I told XXXX I was also having a hard time with letters and notifications on disputes. XXXX said she would send it out again. I told her if it didnt appear again that I would call back and request another one. 

On XX/XX/2020, I talked to XXXX in customer service. I asked for a copy of my cardholder agreement. I told him it wasn't showing up in the Notifications and Letters page. XXXX put me on hold and stated was going to discuss with escalations team. XXXX stated they had just sent it out ( I told him it still wasn't in Notices and Letters ) and he replied I would get it in 7 days.

The Notices and Letters Notifications states that documentation will be left there for 12 months from the date made available. As you can see, I have 11 notices. I should have more than 11 notices. Documentation has vanished. 

I am signed up for paperless settings. Citibank has nearly always sent dispute and other notifications by this means. They rarely send me one by US mail, although there are a few exceptions.

Finally, I have asked billing disputes in writing for complete dispute paperwork including the merchants response on nearly all of my disputes. To date, I have only received a few in my Notices and Letters page. 

I am asking that Citibank send me the appropriate paperwork on my disputes. I am providing you with screen prints of the Notifications and Letters page to demonstrate the proper paperwork is not there. I am also providing you with screen prints of the e-mails sent to billing disputes alerting them to the problem starting on XX/XX/2020. I am sending you screen prints demonstrating I am signed up for paperless setting as well as the terms and conditions. I am finally sending you a couple of examples of the e-mails I am receiving with the dates included so you can compare it to the page in order to demonstrate they are not appearing.

The Rep persuaded me to switch to Reward Card, and I can transfer my approximate XXXX points to the new card. 

I told the Rep that I would to use the points to book a flight very soon, and I can use the 25 % extra travel bonus for purchasing the flight, I want to make sure that I do not lose it by transferring it. I emphasized it that I do not want to lose it, so the Rep put me on hold to double check it, coming back to reassure me that as long as I use it in 14 days, the 25 % travel bonus will still apply. With that promise to me, she switched it using the same credit card account number. 

On XX/XX/2020, I wanted to book the flight, I was surprised to find that I lost the 25 % travel bonus by switching it. I started calling/live chat Citi, every time I called them, I had to repeat the same story, and then being transferred here and there. I started faxing Citi letters and proofs. I told them that the phone conversation was recorded on XX/XX/20 ' ( XXXX XXXX  PST for 41 minutes ), the Rep misled me, I wanted Citi to fix it. 

I may lose more or all benefit with time restriction, and I need to book the flight now, I asked if they can call/email/fax me their responses, but they only sent me letters, which usually took a week. They would not even faxed me the letter before mailing out. 
Per their request, I had recently faxed them the Premiere Card 's Directory of Service to show the 25 % travel bonus and a statement with my name on it. I got the response today basically saying that nothing was wrong, if I still have the dispute, call them! 

So more than a month had passed, I still could not resolve the dispute. I started wondering if Citi wants to delay it until I lose all points? If I exceed the time restriction not using the points, I could forfeit all points. Citi never mentioned the recorded phone conversation in their response to me, even if I asked them to listen to it more than once ; so, the recording is only used it in their favor? when it is not, then just ignore it?",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,941XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/04/20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3553156

I have always been an excellent Citibank customer since XXXX when I opened this account and I have always paid my account on time. When Citibank closed my account, it hurt my credit score because there is a significant balance on this account. I am very aware that as much as 30 % of my credit score is  based on the relationship between my credit card balance and my credit card limit. The action of Citibank closing this account caused me to be significantly over my credit limit, because there is no longer a credit limit reported on this closed account. 

This is very upsetting to me because during this difficult time with Covid-19, I am trying to secure financing for my business and the action by Citibank in closing my account hurt my credit score and is hurting my ability to receive the financing that I need to sustain my business in this most difficult time. 

During my phone conversation with Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX, they informed me that the reason they closed my account was because they attempted to draft my checking account for the minimum payment due on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX but were unsuccessful. Once I learned of this error, I called Citibank and cleared up the problem. Again, I have never been late.

After I input the required information into the registration page, I received a message stating "" We can not register and/or activate your card at this time. Please call Technical Service at XXXX. '' I called the number and it connected me to the Fraud Center. I was told that there was a problem with my card and that they would need an account verification either by email or regular mail. They would not tell me what the problem was, so I agreed to receive the verification. I waited for about one week and had not received anything, so I decided to try to register again and received the same results. At this point, my payment due date XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) was 2 days away. I called the number on the back of the card to make a payment by phone, and again was transferred to the Fraud Department, and they told me the same thing, that they can't tell me what's wrong with my card, and that I would have to wait for the verification to arrive. I asked them how I could make a payment and they said they would transfer me to the payment department. I was connected to the payment department, and they told me there would be a XXXX-dollar charge for processing my payment. I declined and asked how I could avoid the charge, and they said that they could transfer me to the automated system. I agreed. When they transferred me to the automated system, it never connected me, and instead transferred me to the Fraud Center again. I spoke to a different person, and they again refused to tell me what the problem with my account was. I also asked to speak to a manager but was told that one was not available. 

This whole process cost me a {$29.00} late fee because I had to mail my payment in, which they received 2 days late.

05/19/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,"Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers",Didn't receive advertised or promotional terms,"XX/XX/2020 I applied online and was approved for a Home Depot consumer credit card issued by Citibank , N.A . ( account # ending in XXXX ). 
I applied for the card to take advantage of a new account discount advertised on Home Depot 's website. 
In pertinent part, the website states the following with respect to the subject discount : This offer is redeemable for either a {$25.00} discount on a single-receipt purchase of {$25.00} up to {$290.00}, a {$50.00} discount on a single-receipt purchase of {$300.00} up to {$990.00} or a {$100.00} discount on a single-receipt purchase of {$1000.00} or more within 30 days of your account open date at The Home Depot retail stores or homedepot.com when made with your The Home Depot Consumer Credit Card, The Home Depot Home Improver Card, The Home Depot Commercial Revolving Charge, or The Home Depot Commercial Account. 
On that date, and in reliance upon this representation, I used my new Home Depot consumer credit card to purchase an electric lawnmower ( Mower 1 ) ( order # XXXX in the amount of {$330.00} ). 
Pursuant to the terms of the new account promotion, the promised {$50.00} discount was applied to the purchase. 


XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/2020 I took receipt of Mower 1 ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and its battery ( XX/XX/XXXX ), which had been delivered to my local Home Depot ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, VA XXXX ). 


XX/XX/2020 - XX/XX/2020 I used Mower 1 several times and, after attempting to troubleshoot the problem, concluded it was defective. 
I decided to return Mower 1 to my local Home Depot. 
I identified a different lawnmower that I wished to purchase ; it was in stock at my local Home Depot ( Mower 2 ) for {$390.00}. 


XX/XX/2020 Given I opened a Home Depot consumer credit card account to avail myself of the {$50.00} discount, I wanted to ensure that Citibank would honor the discount when I exchanged the defective Mower 1 for Mower 2. 
I called Citibank using the Customer Service number on the back of my card and asked if Citibank would apply the {$50.00} discount to my purchase of Mower 2. 
The agent assured me that Citibank would apply the discount to the Mower 2 purchase. 
She instructed me to perform two separate transactions ( rather than a single exchange transaction ) at my local Home Depot to ensure the {$50.00} discount would be properly applied. 
First, she said, I should return Mower 1 so that it would be credited to my account.

Second, she said I should purchase Mower 2 as a separate transaction using my Home Depot consumer credit card. 


XX/XX/2020 In accordance with the Citibank agents instructions, I went to my local Home Depot, where I returned Mower 1 and purchased Mower 2. 
The {$50.00} refund was not applied to the purchase of Mower 2 at the time of purchase, so I decided to monitor my account to ensure Citibank applied it after the fact. 


XX/XX/2020 I checked my account and determined that Citibank had not applied the {$50.00} discount. 
I called Citibank Customer Service and asked the agent about the status of the discount application. 
She informed me that my purchase of Mower 2 was ineligible for the {$50.00} discount because Citibank had applied the discount to the purchase of Mower 1. 
I explained that I had to return Mower 1 because it was defective and that I bought Mower 2 in reliance on the XX/XX/2020 representation of another agent that Citibank would honor the {$50.00} discount in connection with that purchase. 
She stated that the agent with whom I spoke on XX/XX/XXXX had misinformed me and that there was nothing Citibank could do. 
I asked to speak to her manager and was connected to XXXX, a supervisor on the Citibank Escalation Departments Client Advocacy Team. 
XXXX stated that new account holders effectively have one bite of the apple when it comes to the {$50.00} new account discount, Citibank will only apply it to the first purchase, and wont apply it to a second purchase even when, as here, the new account holder returns the item because it is defective. 
She said that the Client Advocacy Team cant deviate from this policy due to marketing regulations. 
My frustration grew over the course of this phone call, and I advised XXXX that I believed Citibank had violated UDAAP given that, to my detriment, I opened this account in reliance on the Home Depot websites representation that I would receive the {$50.00} new account discount and I returned Mower 1 and purchased Mower 2 using my Home Depot consumer credit card because a Citibank agent assured me that Citibank would honor the {$50.00} discount. 
XXXX apologized that an agent had misinformed me but stated there was nothing she could do. 
At my request, she escalated this matter to the Executive Response team ( from which I received an automated email but have had no further communication ).",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",VA,None,None,Consent provided,Web,05/19/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3659234

Following approval by Citi of each credit card application submitted in response to these offers, I received confirmation of each account approval and the associated offer terms in the form of an "" Account Approval Notice '', an example of which is attached herewith as Exhibit D.

04/29/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem when making payments,You never received your bill or did not know a payment was due,"I have been trying to have the right amount, address and credit card info to pay Macy back since 2015. I've researched and realized that I'm not the only victim to Macy 's poor practices dealing with their credit card. Due to their inability to have correct and timely financial information, I disputed. However, they put it as delinquent and no one was ever able to help rectify to make me whole. Finally, I wrote the XXXX, XXXX XXXX of Macy 's to see if he can help. Again, they missed the mark of understanding that they failed to provide the accurate amount, account information, credit card, disclosures and address to send payment. Because of their deficiencies, I was unable to pay. I didn't even have the account number! I have spent no less than 50 hours trying to fix this over the years. Even now, I resent a note a couple months ago. Still same back and forth with no accountability. This is quite deceptive. They should not offer credit cards if they don't know how to manage the business. 

Below is the letter that I sent. 
XXXX Dear XXXX, I can appreciate what you're doing for Macy 's and trying to sustain the business during this challenging time. 

This is why I'm reaching out to you at this time. I'm thinking that you can help me fix this. For +/-4 years, I have emailed and mailed notes to customer service addresses in OH and executives XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX to fix my credit situation. Now, I'm trying to refinance and there's a big black mark on my credit due to the inadequate processes in Macy 's credit card and customer service departments. 

Here 's the deal - I have about {$300.00} that I owe which I can easily pay - but as a finance person, I would like to have the exact amount and bill that I should pay. No one - has been able to produce this for me. I've been harassed by your customer service people, been hung up, insulted and now chased by creditors because of the poor processes and infrastructure set up by Macy 's credit card business. 

I signed up for a credit card at the store to receive a discount. I never received any paperwork or credit card, which looking back seem to be a poor on boarding situation. I kept my receipt and returned a few items. Months later, I finally received a credit card with a late fee and interest charges. I called customer service and got bounced to the XXXX, another country, back to US and back to XXXX. I made multiple attempts to get the final amount, minus all fees and interest charges and minus returns. Also, I needed the credit card statement. I believe, having worked in banks for 20+ years, this is a reasonable and minimum requirement for any financial services company. 

My ask - please send me the summary which includes the original purchase, minus return, minus interest fee and any excess fees. Please provide the account number and address so I know where to pay the check. Please do this as soon as possible because I need to refinance ASAP in this horrible market. 

Best wishes to you and your family.

I called Citibank to get help and it auto tells you your card balance. I got off the phone and had to call back about 15 minutes later. The automated balance info was over {$3000.00} higher over that span of time. 

I alerted them that something had happened within 15 minutes of it happening, which my cell phone records to citibank prove I made 2 phone calls within 15 mins of each other. The total amount was a  balance transfer to a discover card for {$3000.00} and a balance transfer fee of {$90.00}. 

Infuriatingly, they did NOTHING and allowed the transfer to go through and post several days later on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Since then I have called over and over and over and over again, each time being bounced around to 5-10 diffferent operators and then told "" security is working on it. '' And to just wait.

At no time was it ever resolved or simply refunded while their security team figured out where THEY screwed up, and each call would be several hours of being on hold and transferred. At one point I thought the odyssey was over when a woman in fraud said she could see what happened and she would resolve it THAT DAY. She did NOT resolve it that day, though I did retain her phone number. 

Instead I was eventually blamed saying I had been mailed paperwork by the company to be filled out and I had never sent it back. ( I never got anything ). I was then emailed paperwork which I sent back. When it was still not resolved I went ahead and sent it back AGAIN without being asked to, but the balance is still shown on my card with no change.

Had to pay a {$7.00} atm fee to make the purchase and opened the Citi app and it said something was flagged for fraud. I called the provided number and the representative asked for a landline to call. I do not have a landline phone and they also asked if I had a Citi checking or another Citi credit account, which I do not. Finally, they asked if they could contact my work number which is not possible since all of our work calls go to a general switchboard. 

After these options were exhausted they stated that they would be mailing me a letter for verification and that will take 7-10 business days. They would not accept any other form of verification and now I am left without access to my account for this amount of time and can not even see what he possible fraud may be to take action. I asked to cancel the card and they said I was unable to do that at this time due to the fraud alert.

It is unacceptable that I can not know about the details of potential fraud and can not verify my identify without having a landline ( which is really common now ) or having another account through their bank. I attempted to speak with a supervisor but was not connected and the employees I spoke with would not give any identifying information I could share with a supervisor about the treatment. 

Now I have potential fraudulent charges on an account that is less than a month old that I have to wait almost two weeks to resolve.

03/24/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"Re : Citi Double Cash Mastercard XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( void number now ) Around XX/XX/20 my master card was declined. I called the next day and the computer said I was over the credit limit. I listened to the charges and heard a false {$9600.00} charge from XX/XX/20 On XX/XX/20 I called Citi card customer service XXXX and told them of the false charge. They said I needed to close the account as someone had my info and I needed a new card number. I said good, do it. After being on hold awhile they said they could not get the account closed. But it would be taken care of and I would receive a new card and new card number in about 10 days. I said ok. 
After around 10 days, I called and said I had not gotten a new card. The citi person told me they had both the {$9600.00} listed as fraud and a {$280.00} charge listed as fraud. The {$280.00} charge was not on the computer charges list of my first call. I asked what {$280.00} was about and they said a foreign transaction fee. I learned the {$9600.00} charge was about a {$14000.00} XXXX dollars charge. They said they would send me a new credit card by 2 day XXXX. I said fine. It arrived with the old account number, so I cut it up. I called citi and said I needed a new card number, they said ok and I would get it in some days. I said fine. 
Then I got a XX/XX/20 letter from citi which says we can not approve your request without ever even saying what request they were talking about. 
I then got a bill which did not have the {$9600.00} and {$280.00} removed. I called citi and talked to the fraud department on XX/XX/20, the call was claimed to be recorded. I told them the fraud needed to be removed from the bill. Then they started making strange statements. For example, the guy said : you reported {$3000.00} fraud. I said no, I reported {$9600.00} and {$280.00} fraud. So was this guy lying to me or did someone change the computer case records? He also said the records showed I requested the account not to be closed. Was this guy lying to me again or did someone change the computer records? I had requested the old account closed on every call since XX/XX/20. Citi repeatedly refused to close the account saying it needed to be open for the investigation. They said they would send a new card with a new number in 10 days and they did. I have not activated the new card number. 
I paid the credit card bill in full less the {$9600.00} and {$280.00}, prior to the XX/XX/20 deadline. Now on XX/XX/20 I got a new bill with zero new transactions and the {$9600.00} and {$280.00} still not credited. Plus there is interest now on the fraud. This statement should show a XXXX  balance and XXXX interest. I do not owe Citi anything from this old card : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

02/16/20,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"Received and accepted an offer 2 mo ago to open a "" Flex Loan '' with "" fixed rate of 9.99 % '' & "" monthly payment of {$96.00} ''. Before I accepted the offer, I paid off all debt on the Citi card from which the offer initiated to start with a XXXX   balance and maximize the low interest rate of the "" loan '' up to my credit limit on my Citi acct. 
Citi changed my loan payment by 17 % immediately, by 26 % on the first statement and by 35 % on the 2nd statement. They first said the variance was interest. I told them a loan payment includes both the principal and the interest : that's what a fixed rate loan is : your monthly payment is always the same. Then they said I had additional charges on my account. I didn't and my statement indicated so. Then they said there was a {$25.00} "" minimum fee ''. I told them again, my payment is far over {$25.00} but there is no minimum or maximum payment on a loan. The "" minimum '' is the payment amount ; you pay the payment amount or default. It includes interest. If you pay more than that it goes toward principle. If you charge me more than the loan amount and don't credit it towards principle, you're charging me interest on the interest and your advertised 10 % fixed rate APR is false. 
I was never late on a payment ( which they didn't deny ). It's set to autodraft. This is inexplicable by any math. My math : Loan AMT x APR of 10 % x years in the loan term = total interest to be paid. Total interest + loan amount = total amount due over term of loan. Total AMT due / # of mo in term = monthly payment. 
They went back & forth to their payment calculators several times coming back with a different amt the payment should be & nonsensical explanation every time. This is arithmetic. It doesn't require a calculator but noone at Citi ( spoke to 3 supervisors ) can follow it. Or so they'd like you to think. 
This is what's going on : I had next to nothing on that card bec of the bad 27 % interest rate ( advertised as 12.9 % ). So they advertised a false "" loan '' product to get me to move funds over from another card with what should have been a higher interest rate and then changed the terms immediately so that the "" loan '' rate ends up being worse than the interest rate I'd pay even on the higher interest Citi card, had I been using the card and making direct purchases regularly. Citibank : you pay 27 % interest off the bat on purchases, or they trick you into paying 35 % on a false "" fixed '' rate "" loan '' product.

I first tried to communicate with the bank and applied for a report from the police, but the bank thought that the credit card had used the debit card in my name to repay, so I knew and enjoyed the benefits of the card, so I need to be responsible for the debt generated by this credit card and affect my personal credit. 
Here, I want to emphasize above all, as the credit card bank said the checking account that use to make payments for the credit card is under my name. But I want figure out that is a joint account, so that does not prove that I am the one who take action to make payments and I was awared that I have this credit card. Because the bank 's transaction records can't show whose credit card was paid.

And deposited {$5000.00} in Checking, and {$10000.00} in Savings Account. 

Today while logging into my account online, I came across a notification which says that Citi Bank has terminated my both of the accounts. And I would get my funds back through a check mailed at the address on file. I am alo unable to see my full account number as the online access to the account has been restricted. 

Upon contacting them over phone, I was advised that the reason for terminating the account is that the address provided is a business address. 

However, they can not send the check for the monies in my account on the address provided on file, and asking for other physical address ( with utility bills ) which I do not have, as I have recently relocated to XXXX, TX for a job, and that is the reason I had provided my employer 's address in order ensure I receive all important mails. 

Now, I am faced with this situation where the Citi Bank abruptly closed my account ( even after having sent my Debit card and the Checks on the address provided ), and would not refund my monies in the account - {$15000.00} I take this opportunity to request you to look into this matter, and direct them to send my money ASAP at the address on file. 

I sincerely hope that you can understand my predicament where I am facing inconvenience wrt abrupt closure of the account XXXX XXXX ), and inability to get my funds back in time.

I opened the card in question on or about XX/XX/2020 and made one charge on that date. My wife paid the corresponding XXXX invoice in full. She mailed the check on or before the due date but, according to the issuer, the payment was not received until a few days later. For that minor delay, the issuer imposed {$32.00} in late charges on an invoice of {$150.00} a penalty of nearly 21 % for a bill that was paid in full. 

I attempted on numerous occasions to communicate with the issuer, by phone and by e-mail, without success. My e-mails have not been returned. And my phone calls resulted in recorded messages saying that no representatives were available and either asking me to call back at a different time or providing unacceptably long hold/wait times. 

Because my efforts to reach a human being were not successful, and to avoid the assessment of further penalties, I paid the late charges under protest, while continuing to request that the charges be removed and the amount I had now paid credited back to me. I have received no response, despite the passage of multiple weeks. 

As a result, I have sent a letter to the issuer, bearing today 's date, directing it to cancel my card immediately. I also advised the issuer that I would be filing a complaint with this Bureau. 

I request two forms of relief : ( 1 ) credit in full for all fees and interest charged in or after XX/XX/2020 ; and ( 2 ) immediate cancellation of the disputed card.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MA,None,None,Consent provided,Web,05/13/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3650853

05/08/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I went to Citibank to deposit money for my account and they denied me the opportunity to do this. At the bank they told me that there was a note written from their back office. XXXX told me to wait until tomorrow and I would hear from the bank. On XX/XX/2020 when I emailed the personal banker XXXX  on informing him I got a letter from Citibank fraud department. He never responded to me. I also never heard anything back from the bank So I called customer service and asked the agent to transfer me to the fraud team. They informed me the department was closed. The next day I contacted the fraud department at phone number I received in the mail and it was still closed. I was calling during business hours and the fraud department was closed. I thought this was an error so I called customer service again at XXXX. They told me to call back because the department was closed. I called again at XXXX XXXX  and the department was still closed. 
I then called a different number to get to the fraud department. The fraud department informed me that I need to call the identity theft department. The caveat here is I called the number the fraud department gave me to the identity theft department. When I called the identity theft department there was a message that department was permanently closed. I then call the fraud department back and they said thats who I have to talk to. 

I am so frustrated with no being able to reach anyone that I file a complaint with the XXXX  so I can get a hold of someone. I was informed they need to investigate this. At this point I don't believe anything Citibank tells me because any information I have gotten has been wrong or no one has followed up. 

Citibank is a good company I have had great relationships with them with their credit cards. My mother also had Citicard for years and always praised Citibank for their great customer service. I have even had a Citibank account in XXXX. 

What concerns me is that I spent 2 hours of my time going to the bank to open the account. Then I do not receive any mail for 3 weeks saying theirs an issue with my account. Then when I go to address it at the bank or over the phone I have no one to help me resolve this problem. 

I find it very serious and inconvenient that I opened an account and they want to close it without me telling them to. I also find it very serious that if I want to open accounts in the future with Citibank that theyre not going to keep it open. 

What frustrates me even more is I was sent a targeted offer to open a bank account to earn 50,000 miles. I opened it on time and now if they close my account I am not going to be able to get the miles. I was going to use those miles to visit my grandmother in XXXX who is XXXX and can die at any time. This is the second time I was sent an offer and now they want to take it back which is not cool. The first time Citi cards sent me an offer on the platinum card but they should not have so they gave me 10,000 miles. I just want to bank at XXXX like every other customer that uses this bank! I also want to keep my bonus miles opportunity. 

What I also did not get is their was an opportunity to get less miles and deposit less money but the banker did not understand what I was talking about but it says that in the offer. 

I would have informed you that it was identity theft but it was not. I have been a victim of identity them and have attached the police report. Opening this bank account is not identity theft because I opened it myself. 
I also want to say that Citibank pulled my chexsytems. I now have their inquires on my credit reports. I feel that its unfair that they close the account because now I have to have more inquiries on my credit report which affects my credit when applying to other backs. I can be denied credit because of this. If I have to reopen a new account thats more inquiries on my credit report.

The bill of sale totaled {$2600.00}. One-half ( 1/2 ) of the total - {$1300.00} was charged to XXXX XXXX and the balance - {$1300.00} was charged to the merchants financial Citi Brand Source charge card. 
XX/XX/2020 The merchants delayed install & stock availability, resulted in only a partial delivery & install of the brand new out-of-box appliances to the gift recipients residence. 
XX/XX/2020 After a two-day window was established by the merchant, a follow up delivery and install were made to the gift recipients residence. 
XX/XX/2020 While preparing the newly installed appliances for use on this date, ( neither of the appliances were in use on or prior to this date ) one of the glass shelves exploded in the hands of the owner/recipient of this appliance. Simultaneously, the door of the XXXX XXXX became unhinged, preventing the door to close, thus deeming the oven INOPERABLE per the Manufacturer. 
XX/XX/2020 The merchant was immediately contacted and advised that both appliances were shown to have manufacturer defects prior to their use. The merchant and a XXXX representative refused to return and refund the appliances ; stating, repairs are performed on manufacturer defective appliances based on XXXX warranty. 
XX/XX/2020 I contacted XXXX XXXX to request the charge amount of {$1300.00} be placed under dispute due to the merchants refusal to return & refund the defective appliances received. It was stated that the company would suspend transaction pending investigation 8 to 12 weeks. I also contacted Citi Brand Source to request the charge amount of {$1300.00} be placed under dispute due to the merchants refusal to return & refund the defective appliances received. It was stated that the company would open a dispute which will take 6 weeks. 
XX/XX/2020 Follow up contact was made to Citi Brand Source in which the Dispute Dept rep stated the investigation would take 30 days, but ultimately it was up to the store whether they would accept return & refund appliances. 
XX/XX/2020 Correspondence received from Citi Retail Services stating their investigation determined I would be responsible for the disputed charges. However, the dispute would be reopened, provided supporting documentation was received prior to XX/XX/2020. 
XX/XX/2020 I contacted Citi Retail Services and discussed where/how to send the supporting documentation. The customer service rep provided multiple fax numbers and/or mailing address. XX/XX/2020 Per the customer service rep, the Dispute would be reopened as the submitted 27 faxed pages of additional documentation and the same 27 pages of supporting documents was received via USPS to the Retail Services. 
XX/XX/2020 Upon receipt of an account billing showing payment due XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Citi Brand Source and spoke to a Dispute Dept rep who confirmed their receipt of both the faxed 27-page documents and the USPS receipt of the same documents. The rep advised the billing was auto-generated and the Dispute was in fact reopened. 
XX/XX/2020 A follow up contact to Citi Brand Source for status resulted in a conversation with the Dispute Dept Supervisor, stating the investigation was closed on XX/XX/2020 because of the merchants warranty. After further discussion, the supervisor agreed the dispute would be reopened and reassessed based on the recently submitted supporting documents received XX/XX/2020. 
XX/XX/2020 A follow up contact to Citi Brand Source for status resulted in a conversation with a Dispute Dept rep who stated the Dispute is closed. I requested & spoke to a department manager who stated the appliances are under warranty. After further discussion, the supervisor agreed the dispute would be reopened. I asked for a letter stating the same. The manager agreed ; however, no letter has ever been received. 
XX/XX/2020 Received Citi Brand Sources account billing showing payment due XX/XX/2020, past due {$0.00}, minimum payment due {$28.00}. 
XX/XX/2020 Received a collection call from Citi Brand Source account billing. I asked for the Dispute Dept and was told the dispute was closed. I asked for a written document stating that the dispute was closed and the reason for the closure. I re-contacted this credit card issuer up with another call to the Dispute Dept and spoke to a manager/supervisor who agreed the dispute would be escalated for further processing. 
XX/XX/2020 Received a collection call from Citi Brand Source. I immediately requested the Dispute Dept. The dispute rep stated I would need to work with the merchant to resolve the dispute. It was further stated by the rep, their records do not reflect two appliances only 1 a refrigerator. I explained the bill of sale purchase was for 2 appliances which included a cooking range. The rep stated, There is nothing more they would do on the account, the dispute is closed and they can not force the merchant to return the appliances. I requested a letter stating the closure of the dispute and reason. The rep stated, that would not be done. 
XX/XX/2020 It must be noted at this juncture, that XXXX XXXX issued its investigative findings of closure and issued a credit for the balance amount of {$1300.00}, stating XXXX XXXX XXXX has not yet provided the necessary information. '' By contrast, Citi Brand Source continued to blunder its way through a feigned dispute investigation resulting in my initiating over 21 separate phone calls, at least 4 requests to reopen their premature closures, while additionally providing numerous supporting documents regarding the manufacturer defected appliances. 
XX/XX/2020 I sent a follow up email to Citi Brand Source regarding disputed charges investigated by a card issuer are required by law to issue a written advisement within 30-90 days and the reason for the decision. 
XX/XX/2020 Received alerts from ( all ) three Credit Bureaus, in which Citi Brand Sources submitted a negative 30-days XXXX delinquency account billing.

I believe that they are charging me substantially more than they should be due to how my bill looks and due to the fact that I make on time payments regularly. The XXXX call resulted in the gentleman looking at my account and telling me I would receive a letter in the mail and to call back after I received the letter. The call today resulted in them demanding my cellular number so they could text me a code. I declined that because I do not want to get more junk calls and texts than I already do from automatic dialers on my cell phone. They then transferred me to their "" fraud '' department. the lady asked me if I had any other checking accounts or savings accounts with them and demanded a phone number where she could call me right back to verify it was me. I gave her a phone number. I also provided my mothers maiden name, I provided my social security number, my zip code. I have not used this card in years and am just paying down the balance. I pay XXXX and XXXX of that goes to interest on a balance of {$14000.00}. the math does not add up on this. I have a XXXX XXXX card and pay less on a higher balance which I am also paying down. 

I am not looking for a free ride but citi is doing something VERY disturbing and shady here. by the way, its been 45 minutes and no one has called me back. so no letter in the mail that they claimed I would receive, no call back that they claimed I would receive and all because I would not provide a cellular telephone number.

I have contacted them in three separate occassions, but they have chosen to ignore my documentation and plead to correct my credit. They have unfairly, deceptively and abusively reported incorrect 30-Day late Reporting for Citicard ending account no. XXXX for XX/XX/2018. See attached copy of the Citi monthly statement for billing period XX/XX/2018 to XX/XX/2018, listing XX/XX/2018 payment dated XX/XX/2018. The statement XXXX payment late fee listed as XX/XX/XXXX was for the posted payment of XX/XX/2018, also listed here. Also find included statements for billing period XX/XX/2018 to XX/XX/2018 and XX/XX/2018 to XX/XX/2018, listing XXXX payment made on XX/XX/2018, due on XX/XX/2018. You can clearly see that XX/XX/2018 payment was not paid 30 days late. It was due on XX/XX/2018 and received on XX/XX/2018 by CITI. 

This documentation clearly shows that CITI is in clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), Unfair, Deceptive and Abusive Act Practices ( UDAAP ), and Federal Trade Act ( FTA ) by requesting a lower monthly payment amount to keep account current and still reporting XX/XX/2018 payment as late to the credit bureau. If you see, all other months in 2018, I had similar balances and lower payments were allowed and paid to stay current. 

CITI has caused me harm and undue reputational damage by having credit denied and paying higher interest on other debts. I was unaware about this late reporting, until I tried to refinance my home recently and the bank provided this information. CITI deceived me to my detriment. I had no way of knowing the wrongful and abusive practices in CITI credit reporting. 

If you have any questions, please call me at XXXX.

On XX/XX/XXXX We disputed the credit card through the Citi credit card with the reason the law firm doesn't provide the job and service to us. the Citi card rejected the dispute and unwilling to reopen the case with the reason the Citi credit card is not allowed the consumer to using the credit card to pay for the services. I never heard about it and then I requested the Citi card to provide me the policy regulation statement by email per reason rejected disputed. Citi credit card company unwilling to provide me what she was told me about it. I feel unfair as a consumer without the protection from the credit card company. I emailed again to upper management and none of them respond back to us.

2. We paid the law firm for the retainer fees to answer the court or plaintiffs from our company check with total amount of {$20000.00}. The law firm wants me to signed an agreement as additional contingency fees {$30000.00} to filing the malicious prosecution lawsuit against the plaintiffs. But none of the job and services performs on the case at all. The law firm keeps ignored and quite after the firm got money from us.

3. The credit card total charge rejected dispute is {$30000.00} which is as below : a ). 10 X {$2500.00} = {$25000.00}, which the law firm signed the agreement with me the firm will do deposition, discovery, and summary judgment and cross-complaint back to the plaintiffs which they already know we were innocent. But none of the jobs and services has provided to us and no movement we received the services until the case was dismissed by plaintiffs and court. 
b ). The law firm contacted us on XX/XX/XXXX said the case will go for trial around XX/XX/XXXX. He requested me to pay another {$5000.00} for the trial fees and we agreed to the law firm to charges the credit card on XX/XX/XXXX. After charges, the {$5000.00}, on XX/XX/XXXX, the lawyer emailed us said the case was dismissed by plaintiffs and the case was closed by plaintiffs. We don't have a copy of any court paper as show dismissed from the law firm, he just email said case dismissed he received XX/XX/XXXX. Since the case was dismissed by plaintiffs, none of the jobs and services the law firm has been a show to us. We asked for the action, the law firm ignored and no responding email or call. Today XX/XX/XXXX, I search the case online ( attachment is dismissed court filing ) to see when and what date the case dismissed ; the case was dismissed on XX/XX/XXXX with proof of the filing from the court. That means within 21 days, the lawyer already knew the case was dismissed but he never told us and still lied to us that he was still preparing for the trail. After the law firm charges {$5000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, he told us on XX/XX/XXXX cases dismissed, we got scam this {$5000.00} again by this law firm. The law firm was dishonest and scam, since we paid {$30000.00} as he promised on the agreement to do based on the agreement, none of them he provides and performs to the client. We explained to Citi why the reason we disputed, as Citi must understand the reason we disputed the credit card. But the Citi was very rude and dont let the client explain. The city disputed dept said they dont need to know. Its very disappointing as the credit card provider was treat very unfair and no professional.

01/12/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was an Authorized User on a Credit Card Diamond Preferred Issued by Citibank whose Primary Card holder was my sister, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Around Set XXXX we got a surprise when we found out that our card was frauded by someone reason why Citibank issued a new card and told us to destroy the one we had and wait while they were gon na send us a new one, which we did. The moment the new card got on the mail, we didnt even activate it and we found out that someone was taking money out of it. A total of {$1800.00} in cash advance ( $ XXXX $ XXXX $ XXXX {$300.00} ). We contacted the bank and told us to cancel it. As expected we had to dispute those {$1800.00} since we didnt use them and that balance was showing on our credit. We have been disputing this money for months until the Investigation Department of Citibank reaches out and told us that it was all good and we were not going to have to pay that money, we even got a letter saying that ( attached document ). Big was our surprise when we noticed that Citibank deposited {$1800.00} to a Checking Account # XXXX, because this account DID NOT BELONG TO ME NOR MY SISTER. Unfortunately we found out about that because our debt was not being clear from our credit. My sister has tried calling them many times for the past weeks and they deny to give her any information until she pays her debt, currently she is being harassed on a daily basis with phone calls regarding paying her debt and when she explains the situation she gets responses like we wont give you any information until you set your debt straight. 
I have personally gone to the Branch in XXXX and spoken to a representative ( XXXX XXXX ) who after digging into the system found out that apparently we were issued a care number that was already given to someone else. The Cash advance withdrawals ( {$1800.00} ) showed in this individual account but the credit showed in ours. He mentioned he never saw something like that and tried calling his supervisor who was never reachable and any other person would just tell him I dont know. Finally he filed a complaint to the Presidential Complaint on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX and said that we would hear in 2 business days. I have personally made an effort to get in touch with Citibank through their XXXX   account, got connected with Ms XXXX from the South Dakota branch ( XXXX ) who after explaining the whole situation again told me she was gon na investigate and file a complaint to the Presidential Complaint Unit and I would hear back in 2 days. 
So far I have not heard back from any of them despite the fact that I write them but my sister keeps getting harassing phone calls saying that our due day is on the XXXX and of course if we dont pay our Credit will be affected, since now its not longer {$1800.00} but {$2000.00}. 
We have tried many times to get this problem solved but apparently the bank has no intention to hold anyone accountable for something they did and more importantly something that is causing me and my sister sleepless nights, time waste, frustration and exhaustion. 
Please I need to get this problem solved as soon as possible in an attempt not to damage my sister and my credit score since we have always been responsible when it comes to payment matters.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NJ,073XX,None,Consent provided,Web,01/12/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3493200

Now, we have received a letter asking us to take action on CD to renew or withdraw. When I call the customer care, the customer care supervisor was very rude and states that my account has become inactive and if it does it automatically goes to state. To the record, I have been very active and all my direct deposit and my credit card is with the same bank and the CD is being tied to the same account as well. In addition, I see the interest income has been added to the CD for transaction. I don't understand how a CD will become inactive with no transaction while the entire purpose is to keep the CD for interest at maturity. I have called in couple of times and wrote a letter as well but no luck and no intent has been taken by any of the customer care executives nor the supervisor to help me when I really want the money. Lastly, they keep saying that they have sent me many letters but i have not responded. I have not responded because it says it auto renews and no action necessary.

The dishwasher was delivered as agreed to, but the delivery did not include the installation kit and the delivery men refused to haul away the old dishwasher. I signed a delivery logbook the delivery man presented, noting that the delivery men refused to haul away the old dishwasher. This book contained multiple entries, I assume for other deliveries. The old dishwasher sat in my dining room for a week until my nephew and I carried it out for pickup by XXXX curbside recycling program on XX/XX/2019. I have affidavits attesting to this. The installation kit was not delivered, but not necessary since I was able to use the existing copper lines.

Because that amount was more than what was in my checking account ( again I'd already paid that amount ), that bounced and I got charged {$29.00} by the credit card company for the bounce and {$34.00} by the bank ( same company as credit card - Citi ). I called and talked to them so I understood and I could deal with that. However when on that call the CSR did NOT tell me that the minimum payment would try to be put through again automatically. It did and I got dinged another {$29.00} and XXXX $ ( now up to {$120.00} ). I called to complain about that, could not get through, went on chat and compained there, no one responded, but I did see a {$34.00} credit on my bank account Then again today I get another message that said the minimum amount ( it's over {$2000.00} ) was tried to be put through AGAIN.

The idea that a minimum automatic minimum payment will be put through EVEN IF THE MINIMUM PAYMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID is suspect and it occurs to me is designed to generate more fees for the company unnecessarily and at consumers ' expense.

I believe my information was stolen after my first visit to the US in XXXX and used from XXXX to XXXX to open a number of fraudulent accounts in my name. Unfortunately due to my absence in the country from summer XXXX to autumn XXXX I didnt even though that it might happen as I didnt share my personal information with anyone except employers. During this time I lived in my home country XXXX and also studied in XXXX. I have all the proofs to this. I started fixing this identity theft issue right after I spotted it, by calling to fraud departments in banks where accounts were opened, contacting all credit bureaus, filing a police report, FTC report, IRS report. I sent proofs to banks, credit bureaus. All fraud data was cleared from my credit reports and after talking to investigation teams, most banks closed these fraudulent accounts but not Citi and XXXX XXXX. I tried to contact these 2 banks numerous times, sent all possible proof that accounts are not mine. But they always resolve these not in my favor for various reasons. XXXX is stating that my name was added to an account as a secondary user, but I dont know or ever knew this person that it was added to. Neither lived on addresses connected to that account. I did provide them with all the info and police report as they requested but didnt get a note that it was anyhow investigated or resolved. I contacted them : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and send a police report around that time. But my name was not yet removed from this account. Citi went even further and started selling this account to credit collection agencies and these started reaching out pushing me to pay for something I never owed.

04/13/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,You never received your bill or did not know a payment was due,"To Whom It May Concern : I hope you have been safe during these uncertain times. 

Im writing because I noticed that my most recent credit report contains a late paymentreported for my Citibank account. When speaking to a Citibank representative, they confirmed that my auto-payment amount was upped from {$30.00} to {$35.00} without my knowledge during the month of XXXX. If I had known that I was delinquentby {$5.00}, I would have immediately corrected this error, but due to Citibank not informing me until it was too late, my credit score has now droppedsignificantly. This is Citibank taking advantage of the current Covid-19 crisis, as previously I have never had my auto-payment upped within the 6 years of having this credit card open. I don't understand how I did not receive any notifications about this in the mail, and their calls have been flagged as spam risk, which is why I did not give my account information to them over the phone. When I tried calling them back to confirm that it was them calling under the spam risk number, their automated service told me that they are experiencing higher than normal call volumes and would hang up on me. I never received any confirmation from them until it was too late. 

I want you to know that I understand my financial obligations, and if it werent for myautomatic payments information being upped by Citibank without my knowledge and my phone flagging Citibank 's automated calls as spam and their inability to reach out to me by other more practical methods, Id have an excellent repayment record. Since then, I've paid off the account in full. Leading up to then, Ive had a spotless record of on-time payments. 

I am still unable to reach Citibank unless it is within their automated service that still hangs up on me, or by their 'chat ' function that does not respond back to me until the middle of the night. No one is getting back to me about this predatory practice and it is ruining my life.

In XX/XX/XXXX, several fraudulent transactions were conducted on my account where my balance fell below the {$15000.00} threshold.

01/05/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"I have been Citibank clients more than 5 years. I had a good relationship as a customer so far and my credit score was almost 700 above or less for long time. 

But unfortunately because of my wifes medical purpose we had to spend almost {$21000.00} out of our pocket in the end of year XXXX and we both became economically broke down from then and our credit scores down to almost 500 below within next few months! In this terrible situation I have been tried to keep my payment on time but obviously I couldnt make it every time and missed payment because of poor economical condition. From than my credit card payment became irregular and fell in bad debt. 

Unfortunately I had 2 credit cards with Citibank, one is XXXX XXXX and another one is  XXXX. In fact, I am trying to become regular in payment from XX/XX/XXXX and contacted with Citicards Customer Service and later Collection Department, settled down an arrangement for both credit cards that my monthly payment will be {$140.00} for XXXX XXXX for 6 months ( XXXX of every month ) with the same APR and Late fees ; and after 6 months another arrangement so on. 

At the same time Collection Department settled down an arrangement for XXXX that {$110.00} for 60 months ( XXXX of every month ) to recover my balances I have to pay {$6900.00}. I appreciated. 

Arrangement was made that both of payments will go thru Auto Payment System and from my linked Checking Account. I agreed with XXXX XXXX XXXX and of course Customer Service has the record what was our conversation in the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Arrangement made probably in between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Again spoke with Customer service ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX when I saw there was nothing change as per arrangement made and again spoke with Customer service ( XXXX ) Customer service on XX/XX/XXXX regarding that same issue that still I didnt see any amount change in my linked Checking Account or XXXX Credit Card!!! I have spent lot of time regarding that issue. 

I have no complaint about XXXX XXXX Credit Card, it is going as we made a deal. But I have complaint about the XXXX Credit Card that supposed to start activity from XX/XX/XXXX and the said amount was available in my Checking Account ( {$490.00} ) from XXXX to XXXX of XXXX, XXXX. And of course I should mention that, I am not able to see my present balance even any activity as they blocked my access. I have no any access since mid of XXXX to see anything about XXXX Credit Card!!! 

I talked with Citicards Collection Department and they didnt give me any satisfactory answer but they said that, now they dont have any access to see my account because it is now in the Recovery Department matter. They provided me phone number ( XXXX ) to contact with them, but unfortunately I tried several times with entering my SSN and Account number, but their machine language was replying always like You entered was not recognized. Spoke with XXXX, XXXX and 2 more Customer service people on XX/XX/XXXX for long time but they couldnt able to give me any suitable answer yet what is going on. 

In conclusion, I am still agree with the arrangement what Collection Dept offered me in early of XX/XX/XXXX that {$110.00} for 60 months ( Auto payment from my Checking account, XXXX of every month ) and it is altogether {$6900.00}.

XXXX XXXX fraudulently charged my Costco Visa the following day ( XXXX XXXX ) the full {$210.00}, over four months in advance. I called and they refused to reverse that fraudulent charge.

Citi Cards ruled in favor of the merchant twice for reasons unrelated to my dispute, then finally ruled for the merchant on the basis that the merchant 's terms and conditions apply. The merchant 's policy was disclosed in the confirmation provided. The confirmation proves the exact opposite of that statement, yet Citi Cards refuses to consider the dispute further.

Timeline : -Listed couch for sale late XXXX XXXX for {$280.00}. 
-We get an offer from a male that sends us a cashier 's check for {$1900.00} to pay us for the couch & movers that are coming to pick it up -Check deposited XX/XX/XXXX ( it was a fraudulent check ). 
-It took Citibank over a week to report this to us and we received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX. We have never bounced a check and didn't realize it took several days for us to get notified! Note that we have been Citibank customers for over 30 years. 
-Assuming check had cleared as funds were in our account on XX/XX/XXXX, and trusting XXXX since Citibank backs/has a partnership with them, we made a RELATED XXXX payment for {$1700.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. This was for what the scammers said was for movers minus couch- that they ended up not coming to pick up on XX/XX/XXXX ( the day before the check bounced, but 3 days before we were notified AT ALL by a letter that arrived in the mail ). 
-So, we LOST {$1700.00} as a result of this SCAM by a service pushed by Citibank as a partner plus the {$12.00} bounced check fee. 
-We reached out to Citibank twice with the information and twice they denied our claim saying we had authorized the transaction ( yes, we did but assumed funds posted properly in our CITIBANK account ) so they would NOT help us at all. Again, this is after we provided Citibank all the information we had and used a service pushed by our bank that we were loyal to for over three decades. So, we thought it was safely backed for customer usage in the event of any fraudulent activities. 
-The last denial arrived via mail on XXXX XXXX XXXX 
We provided details of the fraudulent check, the UPS tracking information in which the cashier 's check came, as well as another XXXX XXXX account the scammers gave us when they thought we'd send them the balance for the couch they never came to pick up.

I got email confirm of payment, and the account showed a total balance left on the card of {$320.00}. The email confirm from Best Buy card was received by me on XX/XX/XXXX and showed the {$320.00} balance left on card. 

My account statement ( which appears to have been mailed XX/XX/XXXX ) arrived at my address XX/XX/XXXX and showed an account balance on the card of {$530.00}, which included interest charged on the account of {$200.00}. I can not believe the interest charge and I have called both Best Buy and Citibank, but can not get through either on the phone or on either website. This is outrageous! 

I was laid of three weeks ago due to CV-19 and do not have any income ( I am currently awaiting unemployment as my previous employer is supposed to call me back when this pandemic ends ). I still can not believe Best Buy and Citibank did this to me. I don't understand why this was done to me and can not get any answers. 

I am refusing to pay the outrageous interest, and don't understand how I can be charged 39 % interest on this card. My understanding is that interest, fees, and penalties are waived during this pandemic.

04/17/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I received a notice last week that my Citibank checking account was being closed. I got in touch with them and was told by a customer service rep that once my account had a positive balance it would be active again. My direct deposits had stopped due to being laid off from work due to coronavirus. Seeing as the customer service rep said the account would be active when it had a positive balance I took no further action. The reason for my inquiry on the account was due to the fact that my government stimulus check was going to be deposited into the account. It had a negative {$130.00} balance so after being told what I was told, which I have documented, I thought the stimulus money would cover the {$130.00} negative balance and I would have {$1000.00} for myself to feed my family on. The day that the stimulus was to be deposited into my account I checked it and it went from the negative {$130.00} balance to a {$0.00} balance. Then it said account was closed. I contacted Citibank and I was told that they could see my money was there and for me to call and they would reopen my account. Now, over the course of 3 days and communicating with 6 different customer service reps, 3 of them have said they can see my money is there but that they cant open the account. A fourth customer service rep told me that they would mail me a check for the {$1000.00}. Then the last customer service rep I talked to told me that my money had been sent back to the IRS, which is a lie also. I do not mind paying them what I owed for the negative balance but, I had been waiting on that money so I could provide for my family and they turn into monsters and decide that they are going to hold my money hostage. All of this has made me XXXX  as a man that cant provide for his family does not deserve to live. Its been lie after lie after lie. How could they, and would they, close a mans account on the day he is to receive such a deposit into it as this stimulus money was to be and for what it means to him and his family. They said that when a account has a negative balance for so many days it is then closed. Well they couldnt give me one more day in order to receive that money? And seeing as what familys all across this country are going through. Now, I cant get ahold of anyone and do not know when or how I am going to get access to my money in order to feed my family.

05/31/20,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"This is a complaint about FRAUD AND ID THEFT by withdrawing money from my savings account at Citibank. 

Someone registered on XXXX  using false documentation and my personal bank details, which I have kept confidential without sharing with anyone, and made several automatic debits for usd {$500.00} without notification from the bank to me that this was happening. The debits started in XX/XX/XXXX until XXXX of that year when I realized what happened and started a claim with Citibank. The number of transactions made exceeded the limit of transactions allowed by United States Federal Law, and the bank did not stop these transactions, concluding with the closing of my account for that reason. For example inXX/XX/XXXX 10 withdrawals were made from my account and the limit is 6. 

The detail of the transactions are as follows : Transaction Date / Amount XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$500.00} Additionally, in XX/XX/XXXX I went in person to XXXX Florida to the office where I opened my account, in which the bank agent indicated that the ATM card that I had was invalid and that there was another card number to my name in the system, which I never requested and was not in my possession. For security the agent proceeded to request a new debit card. 

Until now, the bank has not been able to deeply investigate what happened to my savings account and my ATM card, and as custodians of my money they must do the investigation with XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX to demonstrate what really happened.

01/04/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with rewards from credit card,"This complaint concern Citi and XXXX XXXX and the unfair practices they have used with regards to their Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select cards and the miles they provide for promotional bonuses and regular spending. 

Over the last several years I have earned AAdvantage miles through bonus offers provided by Citi and paid out by XXXX XXXX. I have also earned miles through regular spending on my card. Because I own several XXXX, in the past I have opened several Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select cards. I only contemplated opening a second card because an XXXX XXXX flight attendant was attempting to get passengers on a flight to sign up for one of the credit card offers. I mentioned to her that I already had a card, and she informed me that as long as the application didn't specify any terms about not being eligible, that I could apply for another card and earn the bonus again. 

As a result I accrued a fairly substantial AAdvantage program balance. 

On XX/XX/2019 I attempted to book a reservation using some of my miles. The process for booking an AAdvantage award reservation involved "" booking '' the reservation, and then waiting for the airline to actually "" ticket '' it. After booking, the reservation will stay in a "" ticket pending '' mode until the ticketing department issues the ticket and deducts the miles from your account to pay for it. This process typically takes a few hours. In my case it had been 24 hours and it still had not ticketed so I called in to try and resolve the issue. The next day I spoke to an agent who rebooked the reservation to try and solve the problem, but after another 24 hours this new reservation also had not been ticketed. 

I called in once again and after a long time on the phone, I was told my AAdvantage account had been "" locked '' by XXXX XXXX and that I would be unable to use my account. I asked why the account had been locked and was provided no information. Since that day I have called into AAdvantage customer service, called and left several voicemails at the XXXX XXXX department, emailed customer relations, messaged the airline 's XXXX account, emailed several members of staff ( including executives ), and sent paper mail to several employees ( once again, including executives ). I have yet to receive an explanation for why my account is locked, and I continue to be unable to utilize my miles. 

Since this issue, I have done some research and learned the airline is apparently locking and shutting down several hundred or thousand accounts in a similar fashion with no explanation. Some customers have been shut down and had reservations cancelled while overseas - being left stranded by XXXX XXXX ' deceptive business practices. The theory is that XXXX XXXX is punishing customers who utilized the Citi credit card bonus offers, despite the terms and conditions allowing them to. Some customers had as little as one or two bonuses provided to them, and were still terminated by XXXX XXXX. This is unbelievable. 

Despite XXXX XXXX and Citi being seperate entities, I thought the entangled nature of their business relationship was vital to this issue. I reached out to Citi 's executive department to explain the situation and see what they could do to remedy the problem. My opinion is that Citi and XXXX XXXX are effective operating a credit card rewards program in which you earn "" miles '' which you can use on a variety of items - from flights, to gift cards, to hotels, to rental cars. In this way, despite them calling these "" miles '', the AAdvantage program is essentially a rewards program. But in this case, Citi has outsourced the rewards program to XXXX XXXX. 

Because I rightfully earned these "" miles '' through clear terms and conditions, I feel that Citi is obligated to either work with XXXX XXXX to reopen my account, or provide me some form of compensation ( either in their native XXXX Points rewards, or in cash ) that is equal to the value of the points I am losing and unable to use. 

Citi refused to assist me in the matter. 

Citi and XXXX XXXX are essentially engaging in Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices ( UDAAP ), and have failed to deliver on the terms of the offers I enrolled in and rightfully earned. 

It has been a month since my account was locked, and I see no end in sight to this issue. I require the assistance of the CFPB to help me solve this problem. The bank and the airline seem uninterested in assisting or even providing an explanation as to what is going on.

Im a XXXX  XXXX at a XXXX school and we have been forced to close due to this pandemic so my paychecks have stopped. As soon as I found out, I began contacting my bill companies. Every other company has worked with me by deferring my next payment to help me financially and help me not get into a serious financial situation or have my credit score ruined. CitiGroup has been the only company I have received NO assistance even with several calls to the customer service for both my CitiGroup credit cards. Im simply just asking for payment deferral until I can get my paychecks started back, after returning to work. Ive spoken to the customer service department and the hardship department at Citi. My first call was on XX/XX/XXXX, I then called again and for a 3rd time on XX/XX/XXXX and every time I was told they are aware of the coronavirus pandemic and financial hardship, but no plan is in place and bills are expected to be paid in full, on time. When I called back for the 4th time on XX/XX/XXXX I was transferred to the hardship department to see if anything could be done and was told again, no plan was in place. On the XXXX the person put notes on my accounts stating I am experiencing financial hardship and will be unable to make my payment, which is due XX/XX/XXXX, in full or on time. I called again, today, XX/XX/XXXX to inquire about a plan because my bill is due tomorrow. I was met with a very unprofessional rep named XXXX and she said there was simply nothing she could do about it. I asked for her supervisor and she gave me to someone named XXXX. She mimicked what XXXX said and said she was going to connect me with the hardship department to see if anything could be done. I was put on hold and then XXXX picks up the phone a few more times saying shes still waiting for the hardship department. She then picks up for the 4th time and literally says to me that the hardship department is experiencing high call volumes and she will need me to call back another day because she has to help other customers. That statement was extremely unprofessional. When I asked if I called back and they were busy again, she would they wait long enough to help me, as a customer, she just responded with hopefully they wont be as busy. Ultimately, no help as of tonight XX/XX/2020. My payments ( 2 cards ) is due tomorrow, I have been out of work due to coronavirus and CitiGroup is the ONLY company who has not assisted me with payment deferral. Please help me!

I also asked XXXX to provide any communication sent out to me regarding account inactivity prior account was closed, but XXXX could not provide any proof. This is clearly a ABUSIVE BUSINESS PRACTICE of major bank where INTENTIONAL ACTION can be justified all the times, as if their right is being honored for any given situation and customers right 's are ignored, especially when America is going through COVID19 situation. I am sure that Citibank 's response will state that Citibank closed my account due to inactivity, stated in customer agreement, but fail to address the fact that regardless of inactivity going on for less than 24 month, Citibank closed my account anyhow.

02/06/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Didn't receive terms that were advertised,"Under Citi Bank 's promotion plan, if I open a new account, deposit {$50000.00} in 30 days and keep them in the account for 60 days, I can get a {$700.00} bonus. I opened the new accounts in XX/XX/XXXX, which is the start of the nightmare. 
When I tried to deposit the money, I received the email stating that I have to submit utility bill & SSN, but I have submitted them and had received the receipt from Citi before ( see attachment 1, 2a, 2b ). It is obvious that Citi 's system had something wrong. Then I tried to contact Citi to figure it out. 
From XX/XX/XXXX, the second day of the new account opening, to XX/XX/XXXX, I have called or chatted online with the Citi agents for MORE THAN 20 TIMES ( see the attachment of Timeline ), struggling to find out what documents actually I should submit, when I can deposit the money, and even who really know the actual situation and give me a certain instruction. Sadly, in the 20-more calls or chatting, different people told me different answers. 
As all of the agents told me explicitly that I can not deposit money into the new account since it is on hold, I had to deposit them after XX/XX/XXXX, when I received the deposit notice. But Citi told me that my account does not qualify for the promotion bonus any more as I hadnt deposited the money in 30 days after account opening. It is so ridiculous! 
Firstly, it is the Citi agents who told me not to deposit the money when the documents were reviewed, which can be proved by the transcripts attached. Even more absurd is when the supervisor of the department rejected my complaint, she told me ACTUALLY I COULD deposit even the account is on hold. Who should I believe? 
Secondly, it is Citis confused management that led to the delay of document review. They kept on requesting the same documents which had been confirmed by their own system, they didnt send even one single message to request form W9 I only know it when I called by myself. I am even not sure when they have received all of my documents. 
Thirdly, Even the agent online who knows all of the processes admitted : since there was a delay of the account opening due to those documentation purposes, I'm sure that our Specialist team can enroll your account for this offer. But Citi just rejected my bonus disregarding all of the process and the records clearly kept in their system. 
I have attached the timeline of the whole case, I have attached all of the transcripts I chatted with Citi agents, and I think Citi has all of the call records in their system.

I was told to simply meet the spending requirement and they would see what could be done. Had I been told there was no flexibility I could have had the opportunity to meet the time frame they required. 

I met the spending requirement well within the three months of receiving the card but shortly after the three months of account opening. I followed up with Citi and they declined my request for issuing of Points based on their terms of spending needing to happened with the three months of account opening. 

Whether purposeful or accidental, Citi 's delaying my receipt of the card did not allow me a reasonable or fair opportunity to meet the promotional terms that they set forth. Furthermore, follow up with Citi produced disingenuous directions to continue spending without any clear indication of a fruitful outcome. 

I ask that Citi issue me the points promised based on the delay of card delivery at no fault of my own and the spending requirement met. I'll be upfront in saying if not settled through this process my next step of resolution would be a Small Claims case since the Points worth is significant.

01/06/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/2019 I filed a dispute on my Citibank credit card against the vacation rental company, XXXX, for vacation rental in XXXX. When I arrived in XXXX, we determined that the owner misrepresented the property. XXXX has a 100 % guarantee for all of the properties it leases online. "" If a guest contact VRBO.com within the first 12 hours and the property is sufficiently different from the add, XXXX will find you another property. '' I retained every correspondence I had over 3 months with the owners of the property, I contacted XXXX within the first 2 hours after arriving and never stayed in the first property one night. XXXX did charge my Citibank card an additional {$2900.00} for the second property I found and stayed in for the remaining time on my vacation. 

I filed the dispute 10 days after XXXX stated it would refund the money of the first property. I returned from my vacation on XX/XX/2019 and filed the complaint on the XX/XX/2019. Online, I could see that is that a conditional credit was issued. However, with I received my XXXX statement, it is very confusing. The transaction history of my statement does not correspond to what occurred on my account, which makes it very difficult to research and dispute. 
The XXXX statement lists two conditional credits on XX/XX/2019 for {$3900.00}. Further on XX/XX/2019, the statement states that Citibank issued a reversal in XX/XX/2019. This is not possible because I did not leave for my vacation until XX/XX/2019. Moreover, the bank also reversed both those credits. The bank issued a reversal on XX/XX/2019 ( per the statement ) and again at the end of this 33 day billing cycle. The date on the second reversal is XX/XX/2019 of date of the original charge, but not the actual date of the second reversal. Therefore, as far as the statements show, at the end of XXXX billing cycle, the bank reserved the charges twice without contacting me regarding the investigation. Further, the billing statements states the bank determined the charges where valid. I am not sure how that could be because XXXX received payment for the property I actually stayed. Therefore, at the end XXXX billing cycle there is a {$3900.00} charge on my card. 
In XXXX I provide the bank with all of the correspondence and copies of the guarantee. On XX/XX/2019, I notice that the charge was still on my bill so I contacted the dispute department. They stated that the resolved this issue and that it was a valid charge. I told the representative, I had not received notice of this, there was not a notice online in my account. The representative told me to provide additional information with I did on XX/XX/2019.

The XXXX statement shows that Citibank issued another conditional credit on XX/XX/2019. I received an online message on XX/XX/2019 stating Good news! Weve resolved this case in your favor and issued a permanent credit for {$3900.00}. However, when I received my XXXX statement, I did open it until almost the ended of XXXX almost XXXX because I was out of town. The XXXX statement that Citibank states, the on XX/XX/2019 the bank reversed the conditional credit, and never gave me the money back when I received the message of the permanent credit on XX/XX/2019. 

On the XXXX statement, which I did not receive until late XXXX, there is a note at the bottom stating that the issue is now resolved. That statement should have been on the XXXX statement. The issue was that my online account was reflecting something completely different from my actual statement. Moreover, my statements were inaccurate and misleading because the statements do not reflect my actual transaction history as it pertains to this dispute. 
I believed that Citibank has engaged in Deceptive practices as it pertains to this dispute and my credit card statements. It is deceptive how Citibank bank disclosed the account history in correctly for 4 months, which cause a lot of confusing for me. It was deceptive for the bank to issue dispute notification online with dates that do not correspond to the transaction history on the statement. But the most egregious deception is providing notice that I have a permeant credit only to find out six weeks later the bank reversed the charges without notice. The bank states that it determined the charge was valid but did not consider that XXXX received payment for the second vacation rental for which I stayed. I need help recovering the {$3900.00} plus interest of overpayment to XXXX. At the very least, I should not have pay XXXX  for both the {$3900.00} charge and the {$2900.00} charge.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",IL,60626,None,Consent provided,Web,01/06/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3486981

But since I used the card from 2017, I never missed any payment, but recently I got laid off due to COVID-19 from my company, and the processing of deposit check was delayed, which only caused ONE returned payment.

I downloaded Citis mobile app on my smartphone to make payments when not on my home computer. Previously my payments were made through my bank account online bill pay. The Citibank app required that I use a login and password for the account to make payments and the savings and checking are both on the same login and password. Unknowingly, I had made a payment and this payment was rejected for NSF, but I had the funds in my checking. However, I was told I did not have draft protection on the savings but on the checking only. The first time this NSF incident happened I was out of the country without sufficient Wifi to catch the error. I incurred penalty charges from my bank and Citibank, but the payment was still made on time. 
After speaking with my bank, I got a new account number to input in the application but wasnt sure how to input it. I now realized that the app has an area to input the corrected or a different account number. Before I put the correct number in the app, I made a payment that went through before I corrected it. The payment was still on time. This realization happened after the last incident and I called and explained this to Citibank and the charges were debit to my accounts. 
We are asking City Bank to re-open our Visa credit card account because this was an honest mistake in using the mobile application.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I disputed a charge for {$99.00} travel charge I did not remember purchasing. At the time of the dispute I did not recognize the merchant. The bank said it gave me a provisional credit, but that credit did not appear on my XXXX statement.

The bank never sent any correspondence about the dispute, the provisional credit or the reversal of the charges. The charges just appear on my statement.

I have included the statement for the period between XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX, you will notice that a "" provisional credit '' appears on a statement for which it does not make sense with respect to the date I made the dispute and the statement for which it appears.

I received a Promotion Letter letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from a Ms. XXXX XXXX, US Head of Small Business, Citibank, NA, directed to my company XXXX XXXX, offering {$1000.00} to move {$50000.00} to Citibank and get better everyday banking. The fine print says The cash bonus for which you qualify will be credited to your account within ninety days from the end of the month in which you complete all Offer requirements. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, my firm opened an account at the XXXX Branch and deposited the sum of {$52000.00}. The Citibank employee was a Mr. XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I visited the bank to determine the status of the promotional bonus offer by the Bank, Needless to say, confusion and ignorance surrounded the matter, and it was obvious it was a Citibank scam. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, now 6 months, with {$52000.00} idling at Citibank, the Promotional Bonus has not been paid. Two days ago, I received one of a series of form letters, all signed Sincerely Citibank Business Operations, stating that my inquiry is under investigation, etc. etc. 
For the few of us that pay attention, and after witnessing the XXXX XXXX scam, resulting in that CEO being banned from banking for life, big banks see their current banking methods shunned by big business, are actively targeting small business and the Consumer with these deceptive and dishonest tactics to generate business. Citibank has now gone from Predator to Parasite. The XXXX office functions like a social service office with sign-in and sit-and-wait to deal with people who have no decision authority on any matter. As in the XXXX XXXX case, the deceptive practices are executed with ambiguity and dishonesty. Citibank should be investigated for its deceptive and dishonest banking methods. 
I want Citibank to investigate and fulfil the promise inherent in their promotional letter to my firm. I would refrain for notifying the Office of the Comptroller of this matter, in anticipation of the prompt correction of this deceptive tactic.

On XXXX, after XXXX told me I should, I opened a dispute with Citi Card. When I opened my dispute with Citi Card, I conferenced in a supervisor from XXXX who told the agent that the hotel had agreed to refund the full amount without conditions.

05/16/20,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Complaint - Denial of medical short sale with signed sales contract with cash offer and medical documentation. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Real estate attorney submitted a signed sales contract with a cash offer of {$230000.00} for a short-sale to Citibank Mortgage for my documented medical condition. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Buyer 's lease expired and needed a place to live and agreed to rent our home from us for the cost of the mortgage during the short sale process. Taxes were not included and we could not afford to pay them. We could only maintain paying our 2nd mortgage of {$220.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We moved across the country, which did provide a more stable climate. I noticed physical results nearly immediately and I did have a better quality of life. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Our attorney contacted us stating Citibank denied the short-sale. Our attorney indicated they could appeal the decision to the next level. We agreed to proceed. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We were contacted by our attorney to inform us of a second denial. Our attorney said he could escalate the file again. We agreed to do so, as we did not believe Citibank was paying attention to the medical reason, and Citibank was only focusing on the lack of lateness of our payment given the current situation of that time. 

XX/XX/XXXX - We were told by our attorney, that Citibank denied the case again and did not want to see this file again until it is 3 months late. This confirmed to us, my medical condition was not in consideration which was the only reason for the sale. 

This entire time we were inundated with multiple requests for the same forms/documents that were sent in MULTIPLE times, or Citibank constantly had a change in our account specialist and they seemed to need all the documents resubmitted and we were starting all over again, MULTIPLE times. We tried to explain we're trying to do the right thing by obtaining a buyer for our home & ask for forgiveness due to my sudden ongoing medical condition. Citibank told us to default on the loan in order to be considered. We followed their instruction and wrecked our credit in the process. Then we started getting collection and foreclosure notices due to us following THEIR instruction. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Our buyer was getting weary with the whole short sale situation. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Our CASH buyer got tired of waiting and told us that they are looking for another house. Funny, XX/XX/XXXX, I got a letter from Citibank that the file was complete and we could expect an answer in 30 days. However, just on XX/XX/XXXX, they sent a list of 8 things they still needed. I don't think this is coincidence but Citibank learned that our buyer pulled out and Citibank just covering their paper trail. 

SUMMARY : We did the right, responsible thing in securing a buyer but ultimately Citibank gave us an ultimatum to move back and confirm once we arrived for them to work with us or destroy our future because I had an ILLNESS that was beyond controlling with medications. After moving back to the home, we had to do a re-modification of our loan, and that has hurt us further. The "" trial '' period was still considered late on your credit. Our mortgage was sold twice now since XXXX, XXXX. However, my physical health is getting worse being in the climate we live, and we need to sell our home but can't as we can't pay a realtor fee just to break even. I believe what Citibank did to this family was wrong on so many levels. 1st we are responsible people which on XX/XX/XXXX my husband and my credit scores were XXXX & XXXX, now we're hovering around XXXX from the only late 's on our credit, Citibank. 2nd, we have paid well over {$10000.00} in medical bills for me since we weren't allowed to short-sale our home, and we had to pay twice to move across the country when it should have only been once and will be a third time now at some point. 3rd, the home that we planned to purchase was {$240000.00} in XXXX, now it is {$350000.00}. 4th, I suffer daily because Citibank would not let us short-sale our home responsibly and Citibank acted as if they were MY DOCTOR.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",IL,605XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,05/16/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3655577

My last transaction on this Citibank Mastercard was on XX/XX/XXXX for {$4000.00} wherein I paid this account off in full. Until the unauthorized charge occurred, the only communications I received from Citibank were the updated Mastercard ending in XXXX ( which Citibank initiated ) and various advertisements. Since I do not use the card, I did not have an online account for the Citibank Mastercard. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Citibank XXXX XXXX XXXX MASTERCARD indicating that my account was past due. ( Copy attached ) I was alarmed because I have not used this card since I paid it off in full, almost one year ago. I also have not received any statements from Citibank concerning this card since I paid it off in full almost one year ago. 
After receiving the email from Citibank, I made many attempts to create and access an online account on XX/XX/XXXX. I was eventually able to create a Citibank online account to retrieve copies of statements for this Mastercard. I found that there was a charge for {$110.00} to XXXX, which I am very sure I did not make. I checked my XXXX  account online to confirm any credit cards that may have been used for subscription purposes, and I was able to verify that the only credit card I have ever used with XXXX is an expired Visa, not the Citibank Mastercard. The subscription service I had with XXXX expired years ago. ( A copy of that verification is attached ). 
In short, I have not made any charges on this Citibank XXXX XXXX XXXX MASTERCARD since I paid it off in full almost one year ago. In addition, this Citibank Mastercard is not being used for any subscription billing purposes. The initial charge of {$150.00} on these Mastercards are in error and so are all additional fees and interest. I called the Citibank fraud protection line on XX/XX/XXXX to alert them of the unauthorized charge but was told by the Citibank representative that they would be sending me a letter which I never received. The representative offered me no help what-so-ever. Then, according to Citibanks written guidelines, I submitted a timely, written notification disputing this unauthorized charge, via express mail. In response Citibank posted a letter to my online account indicating that I am not responsible for these unauthorized charges. ( Copy of Letter attached. ) However, Citibank then closed my initial XXXX XXXX XXXX  Mastercard ending in XXXX and attempted to open a new XXXX XXXX XXXX   MasterCard for me ending in XXXX to which they simply transferred all of the unauthorized charges. ( Copy of Statement attached. ) They have also locked me out of this new Mastercard account online. So, I can not dispute this charge online.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",VA,221XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/28/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3583739

They allow no way to adjust this. Not by a phone call, email, in person payment. 
Background : I use 'promotional deferred interest on purchases ' offers monthly. 
In XXXX of 2020 I had a deferred balance come due. 
I made a payment to pay the XXXX deferred interest balance in full. 
Instead of the payment being applied to the XXXX deferred interest balance it was applied to the XXXX deferred interest balance that was not due for another month. When this occurred, the deferred interest from the XXXX promotional balance was charged to my account ( placing {$1500.00} ). 
I called immediately and the interest was withdrawn.However the situation was not fully corrected. The XXXX deferred balance was put into a revolving interest accruing balance. 
The situation now is that i can not pay off that revolving balance and each month i get charged interest. I have contacted them several times to correct this. 
Citibank has a policy that they refuse to apply payment to a revolving balance when there is a deferred balance coming due within 2 billing cycles. 
I have made all payments on time. I can not get the revolving balance paid off. I didn't Additionally, they have created a deceptive practice of advising the customer, to pay a certain amount to avoid interest charged. I met that value and still was charged interest. 
When questioned about that announcement showing a value to avoid interest, i was told that is a courtesy and they don't have to follow that.

We went back to the store, saw that the showroom model was missing, and asked for a refund. Merchant refused to refund. 

We disputed the charge with Citibank Visa & provided them evidence of what happened. Citibank went to merchant and asked for credit on this charge.

I do not want to pay the amount under dispute, but Citibank 's dispute center representative said that I must pay if I did not want to incur interest charges.

01/11/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"This relates to my Costco visa card issued by Citibank. On XX/XX/XXXX I made some purchases at Costco warehouse in XXXX, CT. Later I found that in addition to the purchases I recognized there was an extra separate charge of {$310.00} for goods bought here. Since I didn't buy these extra goods I visited the Costco XXXX warehouse on XX/XX/XXXX to see what this was about and seek a duplicate receipt for this supposed purchase. The warehouse folks ( including their back office staff that spent 30 minutes trying to find this out ) couldn't locate any such {$310.00} transaction that supposedly took place. They advised me to take it up with the credit card folks. So I then called this credit card customer service at XXXX who gave me conditional credit for this amount while they investigated the matter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX they notified me electronically that they have "" closed out investigation and reversed our credit. '' The reason they gave was "" This merchant has supplied us with a sales slip ( s ) indicating that this transaction took place in person and your credit card was present for this transaction. You should have received the merchandise at the time of the transaction ... '' I knew this form explanation was false because the warehouse people had been unable to show any such record of items purchased for this {$310.00} and I called uo the customer service at XXXX again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with their agent XXXX. 

XXXX then called the Costco XXXX CT warehouse while I was on hold and 30 minutes later confirmed that they had no such record of any purchase. He said he was re- reversing credit ( so I again wouldn't be on the hook to pay this {$310.00} amount ) while treating this as a fraudulent transaction that they would investigate. I hung up satisfied but then got the credit card bill of XX/XX/XXXX showing this charge of {$310.00} still on the bill, and no credit for it in the next ( current ) billing cycle. 

Today on XX/XX/XXXX I again called XXXX and after two failed calls, frustrating automated response system ( that kept saying "" I didn't get your response '' ) I finally got through to billing disputes dept agent XXXX who said I would only get credit if and when their Security Department had completed their investigation ( she couldn't say when that would happen but could take a couple of billing cycles. ) Meanwhile the charges would stand on my account. As I understand it that's now how credit fraud charges are supposed to be processed. XXXX did say I was welcome to deduct these charges from the bill I was paying but there would be no proof from my side that such a conversation had taken place, so I'd essentially be liable for finance, etc. charges on outstanding carry over balances of amount owed. I asked XXXX if she could send me any communication ( email, text, etc. ) that I could offer as proof of her advice and she said she couldn't. 

In sum Citi Costco credit card dept first wrongly rejected my billing dispute on false grounds in their XX/XX/XXXX letter, and then wrongly refused to credit back the amount due on XX/XX/XXXX after opening the fraud investigation ( so I'm still on the hook to pay this amount for now. ) I shouldn't have to pay this wrongly charged amount while they take their own time investigating this matter. They should also fix their automated customer response system so that it works properly and doesn't make it so hard to reach a live agent.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,120XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,01/11/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3492807

At that time, my minimum payments were around {$200.00} for each card. ( FYI I am being charged a ludicrous 27.4 % interest on the balance for the Advantage Citicard account and 15.24 % on the Costco Citicard account. ) At the time I applied for assistance, I understood that interest would accrue on these accounts. I was NOT told that I would be responsible for paying - in full - the entire amount of interest that accrued and pushed me over my credit limit. Consequently, I received a minimum payment due for the AAdvantage card for {$850.00} for XXXX and {$310.00} for the Costco account! This is not helpful for someone who is struggling at the moment due to the pandemic. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Citicard to see what they could do. I asked if they could extend my limit so that my minimum would not be so large and unmanageable. I asked if they would reduce the interest rate. They offered to allow me to pay {$240.00}. on the AAdvantage card but that I would still have a huge minimum payment next month! 

So, as it stands, I am worse off now than when I originally applied for the assistance. This is a gross misrepresentation of this promoted service and it's a ripoff when interest rates are so astronomical. 

It is no help whatsoever for struggling families to ask for help and then be suddenly gouged like this causing even more financial stress during a time when they've experienced hardships through no fault of their own. 

Please see what you can do to help consumers on this issue for ALL credit card companies. Their greed is way beyond normal. 

Thank you.

In reviewing several periods worth of statements, it became clear that Citibank was applying my payments to the lower interest rate segment first, maintaining a balance on which over 20 % interest was being charged. This appears to be a violation of the CARD Act of 2009 As can be seen in the attached statements, the balance has not decreased. {$240.00} of payments were made during the period and no new purchases.

Regrettably, my command decided NOT to pay perdiem or allow a XXXX  Permanent Change of Station ( XXXX  PCS ) while traveling from XXXX XXXX, XXXX  to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( XXXX ) once a week for treatmemt. It was an 80 mile trip one-way and a hotel stay each week. It took a horrible toll on my finances. A XXXX XXXX would have allowed me to move to the XXXX, XXXX  area to be co-located with XXXX for Treatmemt and would have been much less stressful financially and personally. 

During the XXXX XXXX and subsequent forced retirement, both of my parents died of XXXX. My mother didnt have the finances to prepare for burial or taxes on her condo so, I had to pay for that in addition to my medical care. 

Because of all of these financial burdens, I choose to hire XXXX XXXX to help arrange payment of my debts in XXXX. They arranged for all payments and negotiations of debts successfully. 

Unfortunately, XXXX XXXX is one of the many debts that is nagging me ; I currently receive a CHARGE OFF every month although the debt was originally charged off in XXXX! Therefore, every month my credit score takes as much as a 12 point plummet! 

Ive disputed the issue a few times only to find that the amount owed inexplicably changed! Im truly at a loss and do not understand why this continues to happen. 

I am a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Veteran with XXXX, XXXX, XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, in addition to a litany of other ailments. 

I need a place of solitude and quiet to live yet, am being prevented from buying a home due to some glitches with my credit report that make no sense. 

I am currently forced to live in an apartment that charges for credit checks and background checks yet, does not actually do them. Police are there monthly and alcoholics  and drug addicts are my neighbors! The landlord is a slumlord yet, I cant get a lawyer to take my case to even get air conditioning installed or screens placed into the windows ... which is illegal here in XXXX! 

To make matters worse, Im stuck in a hotel right now because my apartment flooded on XXXX XXXX ; the day before the anniversary of my fathers passing. Ill still be here on the anniversary of my mothers passing on XXXX XXXX ; the flood was THAT bad! The management is NOT paying for the stay either : thankfully I have renters insurance. 

Other, more legitimate apartments, are about as thrilled with my credit score as lenders!

The above is why I am desperately trying to work on my credit now. My credit score has come a long way since my parents and grandmothers passing within the past 7  years, my forced retirement, and divorce from an XXXX XXXX husband. 

I have another XXXX  XXXX scheduled XXXX XXXX and would like nothing more than to know that my life is TRULY getting back on track. It would be even more beneficial if, while my furniture is in storage due to flood repairs, I could purchase a home prior to XXXX ( or I could qualify for a different apartment ) would be quite beneficial! 

Your help will be greatly appreciated! Any further documentation you may need from my doctors or the courts can be provided upon request ; I just dont want to overload you.

It promised 5 % back on Best Buy purchases, as well as 10 % back on your fist day 's purchase upon receiving your credit line. Also there is no annual fee. 

offer is here https : //www.bestbuy.com/site/misc/financing-rewards/pcmcat102500050032.c? id=pcmcat102500050032 I have a XXXX credit rating, and want to buy some appliances from Best Buy, so this sounded great. I have an open line of credit, home equity at my local bank, have paid off my mortgage after many years of on-time payments, and have a credit card I have had and use often for many years. 

I filled out the application the Best Buy site brought me to, citibank, and waited for my approval. 

Then I got a webpage that said my application could not be approved automatically and I needed to call a number. 

I called and wound up on the phone with a high pressure sales person who said I did not qualify for the credit card I applied for, but they would offer me a different one, which has a {$59.00} annual fee, and a maximum of {$1000.00} limit. This is less than the first appliance I plan to buy on top of everything else wrong with that. 

I asked why I did not qualify, he indicated it was because I had "" no revolving credit usage ''. I explained that was false, I have and use my credit card, currently have a sizeable current balance, and have used it for far more than that in the last 12 months and for years. 

I finally dragged out of him that their reason was I had never kept balances and been soaked for 18-26 % interest. That is why they would not approve me. The fact that I was not drowning in debt, and I don't waste money on usurious interest fees is why they won't give me the credit line. I charge things for the cash back and extra buyer protection it gives. I only charge things when I can pay the balance off that month as I will shortly do with my current balance. 

I feel this was an unfair and predatory lending practice which I fear will now irreparably harm my credit as I was denied credit! Denied credit for being as responsible with credit as can be. Denied the credit line that Best Buy advertises on their website, which appears to be a trap for people who carry credit card debt, and an encouragement for them to go further in debt. 

They will happily give you 5 % back on your Best Buy purchases if you will pay them 18-26 % interest on the remaining 95 % of what you spend there.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",ME,None,None,Consent provided,Web,01/08/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3490051

I have not closed any Citi ThankYou Card or received a new card member bonus for the "" Citi Rewards+, Citi ThankYou Preferred, Citi ThankYou Premier/Citi Premier or Citi Prestige '' in over 24 months. The last ThankYou card member bonus I earned was for the Citi Prestige in XXXX of XXXX. I have attached a points earning summary for the past 29 months. You can see there has been no new cardmember bonus earned. You can also see the only points I have earned from the citi Rewards+ credit card was XXXX thankyou points from the 10 % rebate that is a benefit of the card. 

I have tried calling Citi to rectify this, but have been unsuccessful. Confirming with both representatives over the phone, I am 100 % eligible for the new cardmember bonus as I, again, have not closed any citi thankyou card or earned a new card member bonus for the "" Citi Rewards+, Citi ThankYou Preferred, Citi ThankYou Premier/Citi Premier or Citi Prestige '' in over 24 months.

I paid for my hotel stay using my XXXX Citibank card and by using the XXXX App. The cost of my two night stay was approximately {$260.00}. No problems so far. 

Some time after my stay at this hotel, I saw on my credit card statement an additional charge of {$1800.00} issued by the hotel. The name of the hotel is XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

I immediately called Citibank to dispute this charge. Citibank suggested I call to hotel to attempt to find answers to the problem. I did, four times, but nobody was able to offer me any information on the charge. With that, Citibank began an official investigation. They gave me a temporary credit of {$1800.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a message from Citibank saying the dispute had been resolved in the merchant 's favor because the cost of the two night hotel stay was {$260.00} and I had indeed stayed for two nights. They had investigated the wrong charge! And then they removed the conditional credit of {$1800.00}. 

I emailed them back immediately, letting them know that they had investigated the wrong charge, as evidenced by the fact that my conditional credit was for {$1800.00} but the documents they had sent me were discussing a different amount. 

Three weeks later, I got a reply that they had reinvestigated a charge of ... {$260.00}. Again, they had investigated the same unrelated charge! Despite the fact I had gotten a conditional credit for {$1800.00} back in XXXX, Citibank was continuing to investigate the charge of {$260.00} for my original two night stay at the hotel, a charge that I never disputed. 

I have emailed Citibank again over this but have gotten no reply. Meanwhile, the charge of {$1800.00} continues to charge me nearly 30 % interest. 

I am attaching the 3 documents I have so far received from Citibank. If you look at them in order, you can see the absurdity of the situation at hand.

Sears sold or assigned my purchase agreement, without my knowledge or consent to a Citi Bank Master card firm in XXXX XXXX, SD. This Master Card, SHOP YOUR WAY MASTER CARD became the creditor and mailed me an account statement. 
The terms of this statement stated my balance due with monthly payments of {$28.00}, first payment due XX/XX/XXXX.

I attempted to resolve this situation by telephone with a Master Card employee.

My next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and I will never pay a "" late fee '' to MasterCard.

I find the actions of Citi to be deplorable making the customer pay for fraudulent charges. In addition, as an XXXX XXXX   XX/XX/XXXX  service member, my PII was compromised during a data breach at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) from the XXXX to XX/XX/2019 timeframe.

04/24/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"Dear Madam or Sir, I am writing you regarding two issue I am having with Citibanks Secure Master Card division, which in all honestly seem like a completely different company when compared to Citibanks private banking branches. I say this because of the lack of professionalism and lack of genuine good customer service and negligence I have had to endure. 

My secured credit card was abruptly and without any notification to me, closed last XXXX of 2019. Citibank then ceased the {$500.00} security savings deposit I had transferred to them in order to open this account. After ceasing this deposit and applying this deposit to my balance the amount I owed was {$100.00}. 

After contacting Citibank secured card they informed me that the account was closed because of a returned electronic check payment. I informed them that I had spoken to someone at Citibank secured card about the returned check because it was sent in before the due date and when I had authorized it to be charged and although the representative at Citi had promised me that the electronic check would not be run, or presented to my bank again, Citibank attempted to run this electronic check 2 more times causing me to occur {$95.00} in overdraft fees from my bank. When they closed my account I was waiting for Citibank to resolve this issue and asking them to reimburse me for the fees I had occurred from my bank. Instead of a supervisor ever calling me back as I was promised and resolving this issue, they closed my account and ceased my deposit without any notice and without attempting to reimburse my fees as I had been told they would possibly do because of what they had did. 

After contacting them a number of times afterwards and no one called me back I decided today to file this complaint because after speaking to someone by the name of XXXX in their recovery department, he told me the balance owed was now {$260.00}. I asked him how could that be possible because I had been trying to get this issue resolved and a supervisor was suppose to have called me back and also because they could not add late fees and other fees on a closed account. He told me they were added because basically I was just stopped from using my card, or rather restrictions put on my card. I told him that was not true and they told me my account was closed in XXXX and also because they told me they had took my deposit and gave me the balance of {$100.00} over the phone and sent me an email with the balance, so I know it was closed in XXXX. He then didnt say anything, but seemed like he was at a lost for words. I then asked to speak to a supervisor, but he told me that he was on another call and would not be able to call me back. I then asked for my account number so I could include it in this complaint, but he told me he did not have any access to it which completely sounded ridiculous because he was in the recovery department and he had just looked up my account information. 

I am seeking your assistance with these issues as this has affected my credit and I feel now that they are trying to take advantage of me, especially with the situation in this country now and myself being on leave because of the covid crises. My major concerns are not only the fees, but also because of my account being closed, which I feel was done unjustly. Your attention to this would be greatly appreciated. 

Please note that the rep at Citibank Secured Card would not give me my account number after I had told him I was filing a complaint with your office. He told me as I mention that he did not have access to the account, but only the last four numbers which are XXXX. I will try to put my social security number in the section that asks for account number.

04/16/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Struggling to pay your bill,Credit card company won't work with you while you're going through financial hardship,"Due to unexpected expenses, attempting to manage a tax bill that was beyond my means, I began to miss payments on my credit cards in XXXX. In this case, my MACYS credit card, I missed XXXX, XXXX and XXXX payments. This caused ensuing fees as well as a rising minimum balance. I informed the bank of my inability to pay and the reasons during this time. I did not avail myself of the ability to close the account. I wanted to make the payments and restore my credit. I started paying in XXXX. XXXX paid XXXX. XXXX paid XXXX. XXXX scheduled to pay {$150.00}. Because of the current COVID crisis I could not pay on my due date which was XX/XX/XXXX. I asked if I could have eleven days extension and maybe waive late fees. And pay by the XXXX. They said there was no extensions, no waiving of fees. I would just have to miss payment deadline with all the resulting consequences. I scheduled the payment anyway. In the interim my account was closed after the closing date. Because despite my previous payments I was still considered 4 months past due. 
When I called to discuss the closing of my account and I reiterated the issues over the last few months and I referred back to my conversation regarding XXXX 's payment AND they were aware of my upcoming XXXX payment. They said my account was still closed because I was overdue. All of my other credit card banks have worked with me, with even larger debt and I am slowly becoming current on their balances. MACYS/Citibank did nothing to help me during my own financial crisis except tell me pay or close your account or you become more delinquent. Even in face of the many financial challenges of the COVID crisis they weren't willing to suspend action on my account for 11 days when my {$150.00} would have put me less than 4 months past due. I had a spotless payment record prior to XXXX. A record that every other bank recognized in understanding my current crisis. I received no regard from MACYS/Citibank. So I want to bring attention to their total lack of assistance or empathy or even regard for my previous business in dealing with my financial struggle. Lastly, I will say I had no intention of closing my account or remaining in delinquency. I planned on returning to solvency and continuing my business with MACYS/Citibank. They had no interest in that. They just wanted their payments regardless of my situation.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,112XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/20/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3609374

During this time I was contacted by Citi Security CC Company, and asked if I authorized another XXXX charge by XXXX XXXX, and I said no, so they denied the charge.

This account is not in my name it's a fictitious -name i do not have any record of it and i don't know who this person is which is why i reported it as fraud in the first place. Using a fictitious in commerce is fraudulent, and there are several contractual defects associated with this matter.

04/12/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"I have a Costco Visa Credit Card administered through Citibank. I am for the most part very happy with the cards benefits, the convenience and especially the customer service. One of the benefits that I took advantage of last year was a 0 % Balance transfer offer. I try to avoid interest fees at all costs so from XXXX through XXXX of this year, when I received my statement, I called to ask what is the amount that I need to pay in order to avoid interest. This amount is not specifically listed on the statements like it is on some competing credit card statements. When I receive my statements, I call up Customer Service to ask how much do I need to pay in order to avoid interest and am given amount by their telephone representative. I pay the amount and have been surprised to still been charged interest each time. The amounts are not huge but these days every penny counts for me. Today, thankfully I reached a supervisor and she reversed my fees incurred since I took my balance transfer but my concern is am I going to have to call again? Thankfully in two months I will pay the card off but if I ever want to take advantage of an offer again will I go through the same process of calling? I get offers from Citibank several times a month for balance transfers. What I would like for Citibank to do is to give an accurate figure on their statements detailing the amount due to avoid any interest. As I mentioned, many of my other competing accounts due this. Why not Citibank?

They asked for some basic information and my driver 's license then told me it was all set. 

I went to Home Depot 1 week after my purchase as I didnt receive any letters or the credit card. They told me to stay tuned or ask the bank directly. When I called CitiBank, they were not able to locate my account number/balance according to my SSN. 

We moved out from the old address since XX/XX/XXXX. When I was registering for the credit card, they didnt double check my current address but assumed to use my billing address. I am aware of my responsibility to update my information, but the bank was not able to find my account due to the wrong SSN they had. Home Depot also had my email address, but I didnt get any notifications from Home Depot or CitiBank After collecting all the letters from my old address, I called Citibank again regarding how to pay the balance. They froze my account and put it under debt collection. They corrected all of information after my call and kept adding interests to my account. I asked them whether they could waive the interests since it was not my problem. The staff told me to fax a letter explaining the situation to the dispute department ( the only way to communicate with the department ). It took more than a week to hear back from the department. Meanwhile, the interests were still adding up. They mailed me a letter back ( as attached ) asking me to call the number below.

I called the bank once again the following day. The staff answering my call told me that he was not able to see the detailed information, nor my fax history. After explaining my situation ( the letter I got from the dispute department ), he said he's not able to do anything. I need to fax the dispute department again, asking them what else they need from me. Ask them if they have more questions. Faxing back and forth seems a very inefficient way to deal with the problem, and none of the staff had a definite answer. 

To resolve the problem, Id appreciate help to waive the unreasonable interests. Im happy to pay for the initial amount. Home Depot/Citi Bank should improve their service as : Home Depot had all of my information wrong ( address, SSN, etc. ). I was not deliberately avoiding to pay the balance, but was not able to ( they had my information wrong at first, by the time I picked up the letters, my account was frozen ) Citibank was resolving the problem in an extremely inefficient way and made it hard to communicate ( the case was not assigned to any staff.

XXXX and XXXX failed to properly investigate my disputes, despite having the documents that show the dates the payments were sent to the credit union. They failed to properly investigate and or update my credit reports to reflect accurate information. XXXX was the only credit bureau who investigated and corrected my credit report to reflect accurate information. 

Instead of XXXX accurately reporting information and removing the erroneous information, they reported the account as improved, which further reduced my credit score. 

XXXX is well aware that my Visa and personal loan are paid by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the payments are sent to the Credit Union two to three days before the due date. In the correspondence that I receive form XXXX it states that I should allow the credit union to apply this benefit. So, if the payment is late it is because the credit union failed to apply the payment in a timely fashion.

Home depo reduced my credit limit to my outstanding balance, which resulted in my credit card being maxed out and eventually resulted in my minimum payment to double. They also, applied 6 months of interest payment to all of my purchases without my consent, and when the six months expired, it caused my credit card to be over the limit ( because they had reduced it by XXXX  ), which further affected my credit score.

However, we relocated from California to  XXXX, in which, to our dismay, we discovered there are no Citibanks. Since moving, I have tried contacting Citibank multiple times in order to have my account closed and the funds sent to my new address. Because there are no Citibanks in California, I have had to do all of this via mail, based on the information I have obtained from them over the phone. 
This issue with Citibank has been ocurring since approximately XX/XX/2019. We had not used the account for some time, therefore, the first step they had me do was reactivate the account, which I did. After that, I followed up with them and the account had in fact been reactivated. Then, they had me send a letter to Citibank in order to close my account, which I did. I was sent a letter back saying they required of me the account number, which I did not have on hand. However, based on my phone call prior to send that original letter, the employee over the phone told me it would suffice if I sent them the social security numbers of the owners of the account, which I did. I was perplexed when I received the letter from Citibank stating that they could not close the account. 
I called Citibank again, this time the first employee told me I had to have the letter notarized, something they had not told me before. I was so profoundly upset, I then asked to speak to the supervisor, who then told me that this information was not true and I did not need to ahve the letter notarized. Luckily, during this time period I was able to locate a statement I had amongst my papers. I was so grateful at this moment. I went ahead and wrote another letter including the account number, and also had the letter notarized. I received another letter saying that the account had been closed! I never did receive a check. It is important to note that I did have my address changed with them as well, so I was expecting to receive a check in the mail. To this day, I have not received the {$490.00}. It may not seem like much, but they are funds we have worked for to put aside for my XXXX-year-old sister and I expect them to be returned to us, as it is our money. I have made phone calls and sent letters but I have not been helped as expected.

XXXX 's strangeness is shown by pretending to connect to Citi via a conference call with the COMPLAINTANT when XXXX 's representative was only calling Citi to skip the authentication to trigger a fraud alert & FTC # XXXX ) COMPLAINTANT has noticed incessant behaviors of Citi employees generating manual locks / fraud alerts, in an attempt to force COMPLAINTANT to call its customer service to unlock the card. There are ample examples including XX/XX/XXXX Fraud Alert where Citis automated system promptly notifies the COMPLAINTANT upon detecting potential fraud attempt via text and email. However, in this instance, there were no email or text alerts that system would send on its own without manual employee intervention, which the system would send should there be a concerning activity regarding COMPLAINTANT 's  account. In/About XX/XX/XXXX, COMPLAINTANT has  successfully registered the Citi card with XXXX. In/About XX/XX/XXXX another correction was made with XXXX. On XXXX XXXX XXXX  PST, Citi employees asserted that COMPLAINTANTs change of email with XXXX has caused the issue although COMPLAINTANT has received no text/email alert from the Citi 's system. ( In general, credit card companies or payment processors would delegate this task to phone or payment processors, who would verify that the registered ID/email/phone numbers belong to the valid credit cards. Banking institutions themselves do not have views into processors ' inner system as they only process transactions that were already filtered through. For example, there is no need for banking institutions to be aware of email, id or phone number change as payment processors would detect these on their own before sending the transactions through the banking institutions ). When questioned, Citi employees stated that reason for not sending text/email fraud alert is due to having to speak to the COMPLAINTANT for this issue. However, this still doesnt explain why ( 1 ) Citi didnt notify the COMPLAINTANT via text/email of this supposed fraud attempt after XXXX successfully accepted the card into the system and ( 2 ) Why fraud alert lock was triggered after around 48 hours. Citi shouldnt adjust its security stance of its card by waiting for the COMPLAINTANT to  open the Citi app to view the warning message, instead of immediately alerting via text/email. 
Having observed similar patterns through the course of 1 year, COMPLAINTANT wonders whether employees of Citi have constant need to fabricate reasons to jam the transactions against the COMPLAINTANT, in order to portray COMPLAINTANT as a strange and/or dangerous customer, while portraying themselves intact as ordinary people.

01/06/20,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"This complaint deals with a loan issue and a Real Estate Settlement Procedure issue. My wife and I would like the return of our mortgage payment we sent CitiMortgage. This money was supposed to be forwarded to our new mortgage provider XXXX XXXX, but that was never done. Citi has insisted the money was sent back to us but that has not been done. They have failed to even provide tracing information. 

My spouse and I took out a loan with CitiMortgage in XX/XX/XXXX. I am a XXXX  in the United States XXXX. XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) handles my paycheck by direct depositing money into our bank account and handling any XXXX allotments we have. The loan payments to CitiMortgage were automatically drafted from my paycheck each month by XXXX through XXXX allotments. All payments were on time and we were never late on payments. 

On XX/XX/XXXX a letter was sent from CitiMortgage notifying us our loan would be transferred to XXXX XXXX beginning XX/XX/XXXX. We did not open this letter for many months because the payments were automatic and I assumed everything was okay with the mortgage. I was also out to sea a lot during this time and not home. 

From XXXX through XXXX, CitiMortgage continued to accept the direct XXXX allotments and forwarded those allotments to XXXX. After that, however, the allotments were not forwarded. Specifically XXXX and XXXX payments were not forwarded to XXXX. 

We know this because XXXX notified us we were late on our payments for XXXX. By the time we realized we were late on XXXX payments XXXX payments had already been automatically drafted from my account to Citi. At this point in time we opened the mail from CitiMortgage and learned XXXX had bought our mortgage. To avoid foreclosure, my wife and I were forced to take out a loan to pay back the late amount. Importantly, Citimortgage never notified us the automatic transfer payments to XXXX would cease through any form of communication. 

We need help getting the loan payment sent to Citi returned to us. Citi has yet to send back the mortgage payment that was automatically drafted from my account for XXXX and XXXX. Citi insists they have sent the money back. 

We have reached out to XXXX to see if Citi sent the money back. DFASs representatives have not located the allegedly returned funds nor do their records indicate the allotments were returned. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Military Pay Operations Supervisor with XXXX, requested that we obtain a tracer number, account number and returned date for each returned payment so that XXXX can trace the funds. 

CitiMortgage has been unable to produce a tracer number, account number, or returned date, despite insisting the money was sent back to XXXX. They have been contacted by ourselves and judge advocates XXXX attorneys ) for the United States XXXX on numerous occasions over the last few months. Each time, Citi insisted the money was sent back. Citi even opened an internal investigation that failed to turn up any pertinent information.

I would get a notice from my bank that there was an issue with the transaction and would call City to find out what was wrong and and was told on two separate occasions that there was nothing wrong with the account and that the payment had gone through. A few days later I would get a notification from Citi that the payment had bounced even after being assured that it wouldn't. In all cases I have transferred the money to another account and made the payment from there, therefore I have never been late on a payment due to this. I finally determined that it would only happen when attempting to make a payment out of my savings instead of a checking account, something that hadn't been an issue in the past, nor has it ever been an issue with any other card. On the last occasion I mistakenly selected the wrong account and again tried to make a payment out of my savings. I noticed immediately and scheduled a new payment and attempted to contact Citi to resolve the one I figured would bounce again.

02/22/20,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Opening an account,Didn't receive terms that were advertised,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I saw an offer online that said the following : "" Open a new eligible checking and savings account in the Citi Priority Account Package during the offer period XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 

Maintain a minimum balance of {$50000.00} between the checking and savings accounts for 60 consecutive calendar days. 

After all required activities are met, the {$600.00} bonus will be deposited to your account within 90 calendar days! '' The www.citi.com/rates page also showed that their savings account would earn a 2.36 % interest rate as well. The only other stipulation shown was that the {$50000.00} minimum balance needed to come from "" New-to-Citibank '' funds. So I opened a new Interest Checking account # XXXX as well as a new Citi Savings account # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and transferred {$50000.00} from my XXXX XXXX XXXX account to provide the new-to-Citibank funds. 

I never received any ATM debit or credit cards nor any way to access my account online. Anytime I would call Citibank, I was given multiple reasons as to why I could not access my account online such as there was a "" block on my account '' for no known reason as stated in a call I made on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told the reason the {$600.00} bonus was never deposited into my account was due to this "" block. '' Another call on XX/XX/XXXX was when I learned that on XX/XX/XXXX they had removed the block on my account, but still the {$600.00} bonus was never deposited. 

I then received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that the reason I would NOT be receiving the {$600.00} bonus was because I was a previous Citibank customer, and the offer is only for "" new-to-Citibank customers. '' This was not what the offer I saw online and applied to stated. Also, during calls with Citibank I was informed that the 2.36 % interest rate is only good for certain customers in locations without any local branches, while another time I was told an entirely different story that the 2.36 % interest rate is a separate offer than the {$600.00} account open bonus and you can not receive both. 

So when I told Citibank I wanted to have my money transferred back OUT of their accounts and have the accounts closed, I was told that I had to do that online - that they could not do it over the phone. And yet they also said I could not access my accounts online since they had made the error of never sending me any debit or credit card in the first place. I was able tonight to log-into my XXXX XXXX XXXX   account, connect it to my Citi savings account, and initiate a funds transfer OUT of Citi and back into my XXXX XXXX  account instead.

I do not understand what speaking with my employer has to do with authenticating the person who is calling.

04/14/20,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"I opened up a savings/checking account with CitiBank after receiving a flier for one of their promotions. Open and maintain a balance of {$15000.00} for a few months then you will receive {$400.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened this account at their XXXX XXXX branch ( Illinois ). I deposited the {$15000.00}. I was told to put some money in checking and came back on XXXXto deposit {$100.00} into checking account. It was reiterated that whatever I do, do not allow the balance to fall below {$15000.00} or I would not be eligible for the promotion. I regularly bank with XXXX, so there would be no transactions on this account until I was eligible for my promotion. Shortly after the establishment of this account, ACH electronic debit transactions occurred to a XXXX XXXX credit card. Dates & amounts : XX/XX/XXXX - {$4000.00} ; XXXX- {$4100.00} ; and XXXX {$2000.00}. A total of {$10000.00} of fraudulent, unauthorized charges from my savings account, leaving me with a balance of {$4800.00}. 
No red flags or security alerts sent to a brand new customer of a promotion account who is supposed to keep their balance of {$15000.00}, but now they are over {$10000.00} short only a few weeks after opening their account? No red flags as to why I would be paying a credit card that does not belong to me or match the name on my account? That is the first time Citi has failed me. Forward to XXXX of XXXX, all of a sudden I realize- wait! I never received a monthly statement from CitiBank for my promotion account..maybe the the statements are quarterly or its different because this is a promotion account? On XX/XX/XXXX, I go into the bank and sit down with the gentleman ( XXXX XXXX ) who opened my account. He seemed taken back that I was sitting at his desk. I said, "" Hi, I am here to check on my account, because I should be close to receiving my promotion, and actually I never received a statement from Citi nor did I receive the debit card you sent. '' He told me he reordered the debit card and didn't know why I never received it and tried to send me on my way. I said, "" No, I actually need to see a copy of my statement because I never received one. '' He reluctantly printed it off and again tried to send me on my way ... until my heart sank when I saw the balance read $ XXXX.I immediately started shaking and crying, and he told me "" well that has to be your credit card. '' I said, this is absolutely not my credit card- you know I put this money here for the promotion and was not going to touch it. I said what do I do, and he told me when I get home to call this number and dispute the charges. I said, no I would like to do that here. He went over to the manager at the other desk and she seemed annoyed with him and told him he knows what to do- she never approached me to offer assistance. I made the dispute while at the bank and before leaving, he tried to sell m e on their credit card ( while I was shaking and in tears ). I left for home to tell my husband what had happened. My husband was furious and couldn't believe this happened. He insisted we go back to the bank to get clarification of this process from the manager. 

We sat at the managers ( XXXX XXXX ) desk and she told us that 1 ) a debit card was never ordered for me - ( so why did the guy tell me he reordered it? ) 2 ) when we asked her why I never received any alerts or statements..she told me that I was receiving online statements - I told her I never signed up for online statements, nor did I ever receive email notifications that an online statement was now available. ***After investigating on my own- I later find out from multiple customer support agents at Citi, that I was NEVER signed up for paperless statements, and that I was strictly supposed to be receiving mailed  statements. I've even confirmed that they have my proper address, email and phone number ( all information was correct ). I NEVER received a statement from them. Until I complained to customer service and their dispute department for over a month and a half ... what do you know- my first statement finally arrived on XX/XX/XXXX. There is no explanation on their behalf. But what this immediately tells me, and others, is that there is internal fraud happening here. There was a reason those charges weren't flagged and that Citi didn't provide any security measures/contact me to verify charges. There was a reason I didn't receive a statement in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX or XXXX. 

This is what Citi Bank has "" done '' for me at this point. On XX/XX/XXXX when I filed the dispute, I was told I would receive provisional credit XX/XX/XXXX and that they would have to complete investigation within 35 days. XXXX, they send me a letter stating that they started the investigation ( This is the only letter or means of communication on behalf of Citi to me, their customer about this horrific experience I am dealing with ). XX/XX/XXXX comes and we go to the bank- there is no provisional credit- The manager, XXXX, makes a call and gets no answers. However, she promised that this is a process ( understandable ) but that as long as the credit card does not belong to us, that we would get our money back. My husband at that time asked if we should call the police, and she insisted that it wasn't necessary, that they couldn't do anything and that we would get our money back. Our nerves were at ease. Time continues to go by and we don't hear anything. On XXXX XXXX, I went to the bank to withdrawal {$4500.00} as tensions surrounding the pandemic were beginning to build and my husbands business ( XXXX industry ) was starting to get hit. I saw XXXX again and she reassured me I will get my money back. I have made countless calls to customer service- all with the same answer "" you should be getting a letter on 5-7 days '' or they are still working on this. Unless I call them, there is no contact. How do I even know they are working on this? Throughout the month of XXXX, I have called, left messages for XXXX and left countless emails - no returned calls or emails. I have no point of contact on this scary issue. An issue that is keeping me up at night, making me sick to my stomach. In the meantime, I had filled out a random customer survey I received after one of my many calls to customer support. I reported my bad experiences. I received a call XX/XX/XXXX from the survey dept., to find out more. The lady seemed genuinely concerned and said she will try to expedite my case. She even told me that, "" yes, they know it is fraud, and that the card belongs to a "" XXXX XXXX ''. '' This is new information to me. On XX/XX/XXXX, the woman calls me back ( unheard of in this company ) to tell me that she's sorry but they told her they were not able to receive a response from XXXX XXXX  and that they won't be returning my funds since the charges were over 60 days ago. I immediately start sobbing. As XXXX the bank manager told us that {$10000.00} is nothing and that they work with big XXXX dollar accounts ... It might seem minuscule to Citi, but it is an extreme amount for my young family. I am XXXX, my husband is XXXX and we have XXXX XXXX XXXX. Due to the pandemic, we currently have no income and have been deeply impacted financially. Our {$10000.00} is imperative to our family 's well-being. Citi has not expressed any care nor have they provided any communication or level of customer support. So now all of a sudden they say they can't return my money? The survey lady escalates to the executive response unit on XX/XX/XXXX. It is XX/XX/XXXX and I have yet to hear from anyone. I never received a letter that the case was concluded. 

I took my first step, and made a police report with XXXX XXXX PD. I am working with an investigator who is trying to help me. He told me I am a victim of fraud on behalf of Citi Bank- how are they going to make me whole? I call XX/XX/XXXX for an update ... this is when I find out that no one is working on this case. The supervisor offers to open an appeal to the case considering the new information of the police report/involvment and she said this can change the outcome of my case ... .Interesting that the bank manager told us not to call the cops and that they would not be able to help us. So a new investigation has begun, and she has also requested provisional funds considering the situation. She promised that I would get a call back From executive level today on XX/XX/XXXX. It is almost XXXX cst and I have yet to receive a call. I feel like no one is listening to me and I am trying to get tossed to the side. I shouldn't have to wait another 45 days for an investigation with XXXX XXXX, when my issue at this point is with Citi Bank. Citi Bank failed me. They did not send me statements. If I had received a statement, I would have noticed the transactions right away and would have taken action. If I was alerted of suspicious charges and asked to authorize, this would have never happened. Why did I not receive statements? On their statements it says you have 60 days from when we send you a statement to dispute charges ... well I received my first statement form them on XX/XX/XXXX! As a victim of fraud with Citi Bank, there are too many inconsistencies. I am either a victim of internal fraud ( taking advantage of promotional accounts where customers are not supposed to touch funds until they are eligible for promotion- how many other promotional accounts are being targeted? ... this account was attacked shortly after being established- how did my information get out there when I never used it..or I am a victim to Great error by CitiBank that prevented me from receiving statements, or a victim of a breach of undisclosed security where others may have compromised accounts  as well ( just 4 days ago someone reviewed that they had $ XXXX in fraud charges in XXXX and their case has still not been resolved ). There is a coverup within Citi as to why I did not receive statements or a security alert and they are trying to brush me off- they think I am a promotion account and that they will lose my "" insignificant business '' so they don't care about me. They don't care that their failed systems or internal fraud has severely financially impacted my young family. I am desperate for help. My family needs that hard earned money to pay our bills and put food on the table. I am an honest and good person. I can not believe this is happening in a time like this. Please help me. I was targeted as a promotional account, and my family can not stand to lose our hard earned money to a fraud.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",IL,604XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/14/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3606425

02/12/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with rewards from credit card,"Macys has a star rewards program for credit card users, the more money you spend the more rewards you are given. Those rewards can be used towards any purchases made at Macys with your credit card. The concern is when you return an item that you used the star money on. They have a policy on returns, that any star money used is null ( which is understandable, rules are rules, I dont get to use them anymore, no problem ). The complication is that when they process the return, the refund is completed but the star money ends up as a balance on your account. This has happened twice to me now. So I decided to report it. 
For example and my compliant I purchased an item for XXXX, when I was at check out I had XXXX star money which I used for my purchase therefore only paid XXXX. When I returned the item, they credit me back XXXX and left me a balance due on my credit card of XXXX. 
I have now called 3 times and have gotten different answers on the issue above, ( 1 ) thats how it works now I have to pay Macys XXXX ( that is fraud ) or ( 2 ) that someone in the back end forgot to clear out the store money, and the rep on the phone promised to clear it out. As of today, nothing.

This is a huge disappointment for me, as I really like Macys but if as a company you can not fully control the star money program, dont have it!!!! As a customer, its frustrating that you create a program and restrict star money from being used but dont set systematic controls to properly handle the return. Further, I would urge you to look into how many customers have been charged by your teams not fully processing the returns and causing a balance ( you have to take into consideration not everyone balances/reconciles their accounts ).",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",AZ,850XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/13/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3528940

At this time- I'm sure everyone has late payments and has a story. Mine was I was under a stay at home order, so my income did get behind. I reached out to the credit card companies, and while some offered time to pay bill- Macy 's decided to run a credit limit report and cut my credit card limit, based on current report. Once they cut the limit -- which I had about 2000 open on the card to use, then it shrinks my debt ratio on my credit score. Not very fair to people that are going through some troubling times. They should have made a call or sent a lettter prior. NOT sent me a letter of cutting my credit limit. 

I've gone back to work this week, I finally found a way to get in online and delay a couple of payments till I'm caught up. Thank you Macy 's, but your unfair credit score reviewing in a time where this is a serious problem for many, made me realize exactly how little you care about your customers. I've never maxed out the card, and I certainly would not do it now. I did not need a credit decrease based on current payment situation. While other companies over to wave late fees, Macy 's does not. They also do not give you an immediate answer regarding Covid help. Every other company I have a card to- has at least had someone answer a phone, and /or if it was an online process they gave you an answer right away if you would qualify for Covid relief as they call it.

I also opened an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX, as their bank has more locations in the XXXX area. I opened the accounts so that I would have a bank local to this area, and to deposit an inheritance from my Mother 's passing in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Needless to say, I have had nothing but issues with Citibank. First, I received the card that would not allow me to activate. When I contacted their customer service, XX/XX/XXXX, I was told the account was put on hold and closed due to them not being able to validate my information via XXXX. Citibank informed I would be receiving the refund for the deposit balance via check in the mail. I contacted XXXX and was informed that my credit report was locked, thus, the reason Citibank could not open my account. I had my report unlocked at that time. Later this same week I received my XXXX XXXX XXXX account information. 

Several weeks go by and I had not received the refund from Citibank, so I contacted them again, XX/XX/XXXX, and was informed by a customer service representative that they could not locate the account or a deposit refund. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor who also attempted to locate my account, only to scroll down and find that it was on the next page of their information. He put me on hold for about 30 minutes, telling me they had not yet closed the account due to a hold placed on the account, but he would look into and ensure it was closed and I received a refund. He said they would contact me if anything further is needed, and that I would be receiving my refund in 5-7 days. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX - Still no refund. Contacted Citibank, and they informed that this account is with the fraud department and would need to be closed thru them. I am beyond mortified and the level of customer service provided by this institution and their lack of support in that regard. I am not certain I'll ever receive a refund but wanted to file a formal complaint, as this, in more ways than one, infringes on basic consumer rights.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) has ordered Citibank , N.A . and its subsidiaries to provide an estimated {$700.00} million in relief to eligible consumers harmed by illegal practices related to credit card add-on products and services. Roughly 7 million consumer accounts were affected by Citibanks deceptive marketing, billing, and administration of debt protection and credit monitoring add-on products. A Citibank subsidiary also deceptively charged expedited payment fees to nearly 1.8 million consumer accounts during collection calls. Citibank and its subsidiaries will pay {$35.00} XXXX in civil money penalties to the CFPB. 

We continue to uncover illegal credit card add-on practices that are costing unknowing consumers millions of dollars, said CFPB Director XXXX XXXX. In our four years, this is the tenth action weve taken against companies in this space for deceiving consumers. We will remain on the lookout for similar conduct and will address it as we find it. 

Citibank , N.A . is a national bank and insured depository institution. Citibank, as well as its subsidiaries Department Stores National Bank, and CitiXXXX XXXX Services , Inc. ( USA ), marketed or offered credit card add-on products to consumers nationwide. From at least XXXX through XXXX, Citibank actively marketed and enrolled consumers in five debt protection add-on products : AccountCare, Balance Protector, Credit Protection, Credit Protector, and Payment Safeguard. These products promised to cancel a consumers payment or balance, or defer the payment due date, if the consumer experienced certain hardships, such as job loss, disability, hospitalization, and certain life events, such as marriage or divorce. Citibank also marketed and sold other add-on products  XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and Citi Credit Monitoring Services that offered credit-monitoring or credit-report-retrieval services. Citibank also offered Watch-Guard Preferred, a  wallet-protection service that notified credit and debit card issuers if the consumers reported a card lost or stolen. 

Deceptive Marketing The Bureau found that Citibank or its service providers marketed these products deceptively during telemarketing calls, online enrollment, point-of-sale application and enrollment at retailers, or when enrolled consumers later called to cancel certain products. For example, confusing text on pin-pad offer screens at the point of sale increased the likelihood that consumers applying for credit cards at a retailer would not realize they were both applying for credit and purchasing debt-protection coverage. These illegal practices affected an estimated 4.8 million consumer accounts. Among other things, Citibanks misleading or illegal marketing or retention practices included : Misrepresenting cost and fees for coverage : In some cases, telemarketers misrepresented or did not inform the consumer about the cost of the products. In certain telemarketing scripts, Citibank instructed telemarketers to claim a blanket free 30-day trial period, when Citibank still charged consumers during the initial 30 days of membership. In other instances, Citibank failed to inform consumers that they would be billed after the 30-day trial period if they did not cancel the product. Citibank also told some consumers they could avoid the fee by paying their balance in full by the due date. But to avoid the fee, consumers had to pay off the balance before the end of their billing cycle so that there would be no balance on the account when billing statements went out. 
Misrepresenting benefits of some products : For consumers who signed up for a credit-monitoring product, Citibank claimed the fraud alert service on credit card accounts would alert them of fraudulent purchases. In fact, the credit-monitoring product only provided alerts to changes in a consumers credit file maintained by major reporting companies, not at the transaction level. Citibank also misled consumers in telemarketing calls and in online marketing about the credit score benefit. It told consumers the credit score was generated from all the three major credit reporting companies, when in reality the score was generated by a third-party vendor. 
Illegal practices in the enrollment process : During telemarketing calls, Citibanks nonbank subsidiary, XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX. ( USA ), used illegal practices to enroll consumers in these products. That company used leading questions to obtain billing authorizations from consumers for certain add-on products. It also enrolled some consumers without any billing authorization or by construing ambiguous responses during calls for a billing authorization as permission for enrollment, and then charged consumers for the products. 
Misrepresenting or omitting information about eligibility for coverage : In some instances, consumers disclosed information to Citibank indicating that they would be ineligible for certain benefits. However, Citibank failed to inform them that they would be ineligible to receive the product benefits and still enrolled them in the product. 
Unfair Billing Practices Under federal law, in order for Citibank or its vendors to obtain consumers credit information to provide the credit-monitoring or credit-report-retrieval services for certain add-on products, consumers generally must authorize access to that information. In many instances, however, Citibank billed consumers for these products without having the authorization necessary to perform the credit-monitoring and credit-report-retrieval services. In other cases, Citibank or its vendors could not provide the promised services for other reasons, such as when the consumers information could not be found in the consumer reporting companies files. As a result, Citibank : Charged consumers for benefits they did not receive : Citibank charged consumers whose authorizations were not in order or who could not receive the credit monitoring or other benefits. The company continued to charge consumers for services they were not receiving, in some cases for the entire time the consumer had the product. 
Failed to provide product benefits : Consumers may have been under the impression that their credit was being monitored for fraud and identity theft, when, in fact, these services were either not being performed at all, or were only partially performed. 
Citibank engaged in these unfair billing practices from at least XXXX through XXXX. About 2.2 million consumer accounts were improperly billed product fees while not receiving the full product services. 

Deceptive Collection Practices When collecting payment on delinquent retailer-affiliated credit card accounts, Citibank offered consumers the option to pay by phone using a checking account, so the payment would post to the account on the same day. There was a {$14.00} fee associated with using this option. Citibank misled consumers by not disclosing the purpose of the expedited payment fee. It misrepresented the payment fee as a processing fee and did not explain that the fee was to post payment to the account on the same day it was made rather than a fee to allow payment. Citibank also failed to disclose other no-cost payment alternatives. The company charged the fee even though it was rarely in the consumers interest to pay the fee so that the payment would post on the same day. 

Enforcement Action Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the CFPB has the authority to take action against institutions engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices, or other violations of federal consumer financial law. This is the tenth action the Bureau has taken against companies for illegal practices in the marketing or administration of add-on products and services. The CFPBs order requires that Citibank : Provide {$700.00} XXXX in relief to roughly 8.8 million consumer accounts : Citibank must provide approximately {$470.00} million in consumer relief to about 4.8 million consumer accounts as a result of the deceptive marketing or retention practices. It also must pay approximately {$190.00} million to roughly 2.2 million consumer accounts that enrolled in the credit monitoring products and were charged while Citibank did not perform all of the promised services. Department Stores National Bank must provide about {$23.00} million in consumer relief to almost 1.8 million consumer accounts for  charging expedited payment fees on these delinquent accounts. 
Conveniently repay consumers : Citibank will reimburse consumers affected by these practices. Consumers who are eligible for a refund do not have to take any action to get their refund. For the unfair billing practices related to the credit-monitoring products, Citibank has completed reimbursement to eligible consumers. For eligible consumers who have not received refunds yet, Citibank will initiate and complete a remediation process to reimburse those consumers. 
End unfair billing practices : Consumers will no longer be billed for the credit monitoring products if they are not receiving the promised benefits. 
Cease engaging in illegal practices : Citibank is prohibited from marketing all add-on products by telephone or at the point of sale, or engaging in attempts to retain consumers in these products by telephone, until it submits a compliance plan to the CFPB. 
Pay a {$35.00} XXXX penalty : Citibank will make a {$35.00} XXXX penalty payment to the CFPBs Civil Penalty Fund.

The CFPB is taking this action in coordination with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is separately ordering a {$35.00} XXXX civil penalty and restitution from Citibank and Department Stores National Bank for some of the same illegal practices.

I was excited when I was approved for a secured line of credit in the amount of {$300.00}. I made the deposit by transferring funds from my Citibank account to Citi Card. I used the card for months with no issue, always paid more than the minimum payment and watched my credit score increase. 

Then on or about XX/XX/2020, I made a payment in the amount of {$100.00}. I originally tried to do so with a live representative, but the hold time was taking too long, so I went online to make the payment. I then tried to make the payment by merely putting in my bank account information, but for some technical reason the system would only accept my payment if I linked my bank account to my Citi Card account. Although I have three ( 3 ) bank accounts with three ( 3 ) different banking institutions, I felt it mutually beneficial to link my Citibank account to my Citi Card. Here is where the problem lies, and the stories between my account and Citi Card differ but what is not disputable is that a MISTAKE was made somewhere. When I input my bank account information online, and double-checked it, the numbers were typed correctly. The system accepted the payment and a confirmation was emailed to me. Days later I received an email that seemed fraudulent that said in pertinent part : Hi, XXXX. Your recent payment of {$100.00} that was scheduled for XX/XX/2020 could not be processed. This could have occurred for various reasons.

Turns out it was not fraud so on or about XX/XX/XXXX, I went back online and hit the saved card information and once again the payment went through and a payment confirmation was emailed to me. It left a balance of about {$25.00}. All was well.

Shockingly, on or about XX/XX/XXXX, just six ( 6 ) days later I received a very disturbing correspondence that stated : Hi XXXX. We frequently review cardmember accounts a recent review of our account shows one or more late or returned payments in the past six months. Due to this, we had to close your Citi Mastercard account Needless to say, I was livid! I have only had the account for three months, paid all of my bills on time, paid more than the minimum, and never charged the full limit. I called Customer Service and spoke to several people, each knowing less than the one before. It was the worst customer service I have experienced in quite some time, of any kind. After several tries, I finally spoke to a Supervisor who identified himself as XXXX, employee ID XXXX who shared with me the payment process that has two faults. He indicated that the first try for the payment I put in 12 numbers when the bank account only has 11 numbers. He furthered that my second input was 11 numbers which was the accurate banking account number. 1 ) Most systems, if the cardholder were to possibly input the wrong information, the online payment processing system lets the cardholder know, immediately, in real time that there is an error. It will not process the information if there is any error. This did not happen. 2 ) When I went online to re do the payment, I didnt retype my card number. It was already saved in the system so all I did was resubmit the information. I didnt retype the card number. So it is my contention that the SYSTEM and not me committed an error in reversing the acceptance of the payment. Citi Cards position is that when I went online to re do the payment, I typed in 11 numbers which was the accurate number for the corresponding bank account. Whether it was 11 numbers typed in or 12 is in dispute, but what we know for a fact that is not in dispute is that the input issue was AN ACCIDENT. It was either an error on my part with typing 1 extra number or the systems part in coding an extra number of system error in the processing. Either way, the issue was an innocent mistake. To have my account closed based on a blameless mistake is ludicrous. 

Beyond the preposterous closing of a well-maintained account, Citi Cards actions in closing the account has put me in a worst position than I was in before opening said account and has caused more damage to my credit score causing it to drop 73 points!!! 

The point of applying for the card was to build my credit history and Citi Card assured me by written instrument that monthly notifications to the credit bureaus about my account would be provided to help build my credit history. Citi Mastercard further noted that by my choosing the Citi Card I would receive protection benefits, and worldwide acceptance. The goal of both parties was that opening a Citi Card would be a beneficial tool, mechanism, vehicle and platform to be of assistance, not to embark on something that was going to be gravely detrimental. This has been a horrible experience.

I am requesting Citi Card reopen my account. This has been beyond an ordeal and an unfair one at that. I will consider arbitration and other legal remedies including the possibility of filing this matter in Court in order to properly resolve the reopening my account. The only other alternative I will consider is Citi removing this account from the credit bureau reporting altogether. 

Under the circumstances, as a new business customer having suffered through this ordeal, both are viable options and the strongest solutions that would be asked for as judgment by the Courts, or via an arbitrator along with any monetary damages the Court may deem appropriate from the damage to my credit. 

During this fragile and tumultuous time, I have looked to my credit to see what lending options might be available to me. To have my score plummet so quickly and deeply has been injurious to my personal life and my small business operating options. 

Literally my payments for the Citi card were coming from my linked Citibank checking account. The irony that it is that account they "" say '' they couldn't locate. The very banking account ALREADY in the system in my account!!! I didn't miss any payments, paid more than was the minimum and you closed my account and reporting it the same as you would of an account that had a poor payment or returned payments for lack of funds. THAT was not my case. I should never have been treated as such. In conclusion, this has been quite the ordeal!! Its been personally frustrating getting the run around with off-shore to on-shore assistance ; consistently inconsistent information being told to me about the appeal process and who and where I can send this correspondence. I had to do the research myself. In good faith, I opened my account with Citi because I felt I could depend on its stellar reputation, and because of my affiliation and long-standing positive relationship with its banking institution, I felt I would be treated fairly, equitably with respect and in a nondiscriminatory fashion. I found none of those characteristics to be true! And now time is of the essence. I am trying to make sure this blemish on my credit history is cleared off my record within the next 30 days and my resolution reflected on the next reporting cycle to the bureaus without the need for stronger legal intervention. I trust that this is feasible. 

Im happy to talk with you further anytime, as expeditious resolution of this urgent matter is best for both of us.

05/08/20,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,"CFPB, this is my third complaint to you regarding Citi 's unfair practice towards its customer. The reasons I keep writing these complaints are : ( 1 ) I have not received a satisfactory answer and resolution from Citi, and ( 2 ) I strongly believe that this is an unfair and deceptive practice/policy of Citi that others might be victims of ( I have read similar complaints in XXXX  and CFPB ). 

Please try to put yourself in my shoes and tell me if this happens to you, it does not cause frustration and anger because you know it's a policy that victimizes the customer. 

Please read my previous complaints for details, but in a nutshell my family savings was locked on XX/XX/2020 under the excuse of "" being reviewed for fraud '' and "" being reviewed for closure ''. No one in the Fraud Department or Executive Response Unit ( ERU ) was able to confirm why because it is being reviewed by the "" back office '' of which no one even at Citi is able to contact. They told me to wait 30-60 days for an explanation, then another 30-60 days for the account to be closed. So under this ridiculous policy, a customer can be locked out of their own money for a total of 120 days. 

It was only after multiple complaints to CFPB and XXXX  they finally released the funds. That is 63 days after many frustrating calls, emails, and complaints. Hours have been lost. Money have been lost ( I had to take a loan with transaction fee because I could not access my money ). Time have been lost. 

And the explanation Citi provided on why they close my account? Tell me if this is a satisfactory explanation : "" Citibank maintains the right to close an account "" ... at any time with or wihtout cause. '' We may try to notify you in advance should this be necessary, but we are not  obliged to do so. '' So it's a non-explanation explanation. So they threw their customer on the curbside because of what exactly? So Citi is saying to me : "" We don't want you as a customer for reasons that we will not share with you, but we have no issue keeping your money during the long process, because we can make more money out of it for ourselves! '' Did they address the loan that I had to take? No. Did they address the lost time and potential interest? No. Not even an apology, just a cold letter with unsatisfactory explanation.

I have had a Citibank credit card for about 5 years. This past winter, in 2019, I opened a checking account with Citibank. I had so many problems opening the account, getting the debit card, registering for online banking, funding the account, that I close the checking account within 2 weeks of opening. 

This morning I received an email stating that my checking account was ready to use ( despite being closed in XX/XX/2019 ). I went to login to my Citibank account which is still used for my credit card, and the website said I needed to reset my password. When I went to reset my password I was told my account was locked. 

I first went to physical branch who told me they could not help me but that I did not have an open checking account. 

I then called the number on the back of my credit card. I was told that in order to unlock my account, I needed to provide my debit card number or account number of my checking account. The checking account has been closed for months and did not ever receive funding because of all the problems. I told Citibank that I did not have this information. The representative told me to call back when I do ( this is not an acceptable resolution ). 

At one point I was told to "" reregister '' the card online.

I will pay my part of the debt, but nothing more. The following is an explanation of why. 
Costco opened in XXXX NE in the Fall of XXXX. I got my original Costco Business card in late Fall of XXXX, which had a credit limit of {$9000.00}. InXX/XX/XXXX, numerous items were stolen from my purse such as : identifications cards, checks from XXXX XXXX, and the Costco credit card. An official Police Report was filed on XX/XX/XXXX ; I can send you a copy upon request. I also called Costco to  notify them, and they issued me a new card. 
In XXXX of XXXX I started to notice some strange activity going on with my XXXX account. Someone hacked into my phone account and started to make numerous purchases. When I noticed these purchases that were not mine I called XXXX. They eliminated all the purchases that were not mine, and they shared the last 4 digits of the bank account that were used which was not mine. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I then noticed strange stuff going on with my Costco credit card. I sent them a copy of my police report and asked them to CANCEL my card. My balance was no higher than {$7000.00}. 
In the Summer of XXXX, I called Costco to figure out why I havent received a current bill yet. I spoke with XXXX. 
Later in the Summer of XXXX, I called Costco again per receiving a letter saying I owed a balance around {$30000.00}. The person I spoke with was XXXX. She said that in her notes that I had called in and asked them to link my husbands bank account to my Costco credit card for payments. There are numerous errors with this. First, I was divorced in XX/XX/XXXX, and did not include him when I got this Costco card. Second, I would not and did not ask them to link up my ex-husbands bank account to my Costco account for payments. Third, the last 4 digits they said I gave them were the SAME last 4 digits that the XXXX person told me I had given them. Fourth, I only bank at XXXX XXXX, and this bank account was NOT from XXXX XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Costgo again per receiving a collection call from a company in OH. I spoke with XXXX. I said this is still fraudWhat do you need from me so you can process this correctly? 
I am willing to pay up to the {$9000.00} credit limit I had on my Costco Business credit card, but nothing more. I am a victim of identity theft,  have taken the proper procedures to let everyone know, and am not responsible for Citis mishandling of this situation.

01/02/20,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"I opened two savings accounts between XXXX and XXXX, To fund the first account, i transferred funds from my XXXX savings and I also had a partial salary deposited every week. The second account was funded with a wire transfer for {$300000.00} from XXXX XXXX. Around XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to transfer XXXX. the transfer was held and i was told for a review which will last between 24-48 hours. once the time elapsed, I called customer service to find out the account was blocked for fraud and my online access revoked. I inquired about the steps to take to resolve the issue and i was told I had to wait for a letter in the mail that will arrive between 30-60 days which was unacceptable to me as i had urgent needs for my money. I called every day between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The letter eventually arrived on the XXXX of XXXX and what the letter said was for me to call the number that i had been calling since the XXXX and that my accounts were blocked. So, after countless phone calls, two supervisors advised that i needed to go to a local branch to get my funds sooner. I live in MA where Citibank has no branches. The nearest branch is in Connecticut, 180 miles from where i live. So because i needed the funds, i agreed to drive to Connecticut to take care of the situation. by the way they blocked my account because of fraud but yet i initiated every single conversations i had with the bank. No one has called me to ask questions about the accounts, the funds, paperwork, nothing. So, before driving 180 miles to CT, I had a supervisor from the fraud department call the branch to ensure that i will not have any issues closing my accounts. The supervisor spoke to XXXX and i spoke to him as well to be assured that i could close the accounts and take my money. So I rented a car and drove the 180 miles and when I got there, The rep, XXXX XXXX, called the same fraud department that advised me to go to a branch, to have them remove the block and they refused. Citibank is holding my money under the guise of "" fraud '' but on their advise, i physically drove 180 miles to a branch and they would not close my accounts or give me my money. 
Now, on Monday XX/XX/XXXX, I called again and the representative told me she could not talk to me because i was unable to verify my account numbers. Mind you i had called between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and me not being able to verify the account numbers was never an issue. They would normally ask other questions. Now no representatives or supervisors would talk to me about my accounts, my money until i verify account numbers I don't have and cant obtain because they blocked my access to online banking. yet again they recommended that i go to a branch to get the account numbers which is the same branch i drove 180 miles to get to and nothing was resolved. As of XXXX XXXX, I still do not have access to my {$32000.00} : Rent is due, Tuition is due, bills are due and I have no idea why my funds are being held. the last time i was able to speak to a rep, i was told to wait for a check but i was physically at a branch where they could have just cut me a cashier 's check for my money. this situation has caused me a lot of stress and aggravation.

01/02/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"Beginning in XX/XX/2019, Cit began failing to issue conditional credits for disputed transactions on my statement held me accountable for the billing dispute amounts in full in the following ways : 1. ) Citi charged me interest on the entire statement balance each month despite having paid the balance in full minus the disputed amount. Cit then proceeded to refund the interest for the disputed charges alone after finalizing the investigation and issuing permanent credits. 
2. ) Citi reported the balance including the charges in dispute to all three credit reporting agencies, as being a debt I owe.This had the additional negative effect of lowering my credit score. 
3. ) Citi repeatedly sent me notices my balance was over my credit limit, despite this only being due to the disputed transactions which Citi failed to issue conditional credits while conducting their investigation. 
4. ) While reporting and contacting Citi in regards to the billing disputes, Citi dispute resolution agents and management repeatedly argue, trying to justify why the disputed charges are valid, making broad assumptions. This process has become so mentally draining and time consuming. Citi Dispute resolution agents on several occasions have even yelled and screamed at me, placed me on extended hold times over an hour at a time waiting for a supervisor only to report there are none, hung up on repeatedly and transferred to other departments without warning simply to avoid having to correctly processing a billing dispute as required by law and the XXXX interchange agreement. It is routine to receive conflicting information as well as false and misleading information from these agents in attempts to prevent having to properly handle the dispute. 
5. ) After receiving multiple letters of the billing dispute resolution in my favor and the conditional credits being permanent, Citi will re-bill for the billing disputes. Usually they are for the identical amount disputed and labeled R- bill. Usually the re-bills are shown with the same transaction and post date. However, on at least one occasion Citi has charged me a different amount, with a different post date, for credits which they state are permanent, 3 to 4 months afterwards. Of course Citi charges interest retroactively for these re-bills which violate federal regulations, their written agreements, timelines allowed to re-bill. 

All my claims can be supported and backed as all phone interactions with Citi have been recorded which I am in possession of. I am more than happy to make these as undeniable evidence and proof of Citi 's many violations. 

These actions repeatedly show Citi has continually acted in bad faith by violating terms outlined in the member agreement.This places In addition to routinely being in breach of the contracted terms, Citi 's actions are also violates the Fair Billing Practice Laws and Deceptive Trade Laws.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",TX,78723,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,01/03/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3483958

This card was closed in late XXXX by the credit issuer and I went to pay the full balance on XX/XX/XXXX on the website owned by CitiBank. 

I processed one payment and received one email confirmation for the full payment amount of {$440.00} -- no other emails were received from CitiBank. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I log into my checking account and see CitiBank has posted the same payment twice with different confirmation numbers. I checked my email to see only one confirm and then checked the CitiBank web portal to see TWO confirmations even though I only processed the payment. I contacted both my bank, XXXX XXXX, and the card issuer CitiBank to inform them of their error. The first agent I spoke with at CitiBank was unintelligent and told me "" yep, we have the payment, it's all good! '' I insisted on speaking with a supervisor who then realized what happened and informed me of their "" system error '' and they would issue a credit which would post back to my bank account in 3-4 days. Immediately after that call, because I did not trust CitiBank at this point, I also notified XXXX XXXX in the event the credit did not show up as promised. XXXX issued a "" temporary courtesy credit while the matter was investigated until XX/XX/XXXX, '' this credit from XXXXXXXX XXXX  was posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. The credit from CitiBank did indeed post to my bank account refunding one of the two payments on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email correspondence from CitiBank stating they "" couldn't process my payment. '' I logged into my account and see CitiBank had reversed BOTH payments -- now reflecting the card having a full balance of {$440.00}. 

I contacted CitiBank again only to become more frustrated because both agents insisted that all was fine with the account, XXXX had alerted them of the payment being returned as invalid, and they'd issued one refund so the full balance remain. I continued to tell CitiBank that was NOT correct, as the credit from XXXX was only a temporary courtesy credit and would not be valid once it reconciled that one payment was already credited back, as I'd informed XXXX XXXX that one payment ( and only one payment ) was authorized. The agent, XXXX with agent code XXXX, was incredibly rude and I asked to speak with her supervisor who also stated there was nothing more for CitiBank to do. The payments/reversals were as they should be and they could not offer any help. 

Not only would I not want to double pay a card that is closed, their system would likely have something that would alert the consumer that a payment is already pending for the SAME amount or not accept a double payment causing a negative balance on a credit card. 

As a consumer, I have spent more than an hour making more than 4 phone calls to try and resolve this ... all while CitiBank continues to collect a high interest rate daily. This behavior is abusive to consumers and there is no way I can reasonably avoid their acts of processing multiple payments and reversing them at their whim. 

I will not be processing another payment until I resolve the matter directly with XXXXXXXX XXXX and will no longer be contacting CitiBank expecting any help of any sort, as all their agents have done is cause further issues and increase my level of frustration.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",KS,662XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/17/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3534428

This termination e-mail included forfeiture of all membership benefits, miles, and award tickets. 

I suffered substantial financial loss as a result of this termination, including : 1 ) About XXXX XXXX  Miles - Approximate Retail Value $ 14k USD. The vast majority of these miles came from financial products ( e.g., credit card bonuses, hence why I am filing with the CFPB ), and a handful came from actually flying with XXXX. 
2 ) 2 return flights back from Hawaii, where I was on vacation with my partner - meaning that we needed to book return flights for a last minute Holiday season ticket back to New York from Hawaii. 

The termination and subsequent forfeiture of miles and the award ticket were surprising to me. The e-mail sent was vague and did not specify a specific infraction, but cited "" fraud, misrepresentation, abuse, or violation of applicable rules. '' To the best of my knowledge, I did not participate in any form of fraud, misrepresentation, abuse, or violate any rules laid forth by the AAdvantage Terms and Conditions. I have attempted contact with XXXX  8+ times and have not yet received an explanation. To that end, I have filed a complaint with the DOT regarding XXXX. 

However, Citibank is also involved in this. The vast majority of my miles were earned through credit card sign-up bonuses, whose offers were sent to my postal address via USPS. I filled these offers out with my legitimate information and several times spoke with Citibank Customer Service Analysts in order to be approved for these cards. I met the requirements to earn the sign-up bonuses in a legitimate fashion. With XXXX  terminating my account, all of the bonuses I earned with Citibank are rendered void. I have attempted to contact Citibank regarding this issue, only to be told that there's nothing that they can do about it and it's all on XXXX  's end. 

However, that's misleading and fraudulent. They entered into an agreement that now I am being punished for - and I would like to seek that Citibank rectifies this by doing the following : 1 ) Working with XXXX  to reinstate my account along with my forfeited miles - they have corporate partnerships that should make this relatively straightforward. 
2 ) If the first is not possible, for Citi to award me an alternate currency for the award miles that I was not able to use - either in USD or an alternate points currency - Citi has an alternate award program TYP, that they could convert my sign-up bonuses into.

Moreover, the cancellation was suspicious because we have over {$750.00} cash rewards on that card. When we called to find out what happened, customer service said we had to wait for a letter but confirmed that Citi would forfeit our cash rewards that we had earned. Because of our high credit rating and patronage of over 10 years, that was an unfair business practice by Citi to act unilaterally and without notice. We asked to be reinstated but Citi refused to provide us with additional information on how to request reinstatement. Oddly, they sent advertisements of other Citi cards despite forfeiting our already-earned cash rewards. We were professional and paid off our statement at the end of the month as we have for over 10 years. Sadly, we typically would give part or all of the cash rewards we earn each year to our children to save for college. This unprofessional business practice had consequences for us in the forfeiture of the cash reward we had earned and that we had to seek a different card and, finally, our trust in Citi.

02/12/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I am writing regarding billing dispute XXXX. I am absolutely appalled at the documentation Citibank provided me. 

First of all, this item was purchased on XXXX for {$8.00}. I disputed it on XXXX for {$8.00}. In the dispute, I clearly wrote the tracking number, that the package was lost, and that I had filed a claim with the post office ( this would have been for the lost documents ). The receipt from XXXX clearly lists it is for postal service. You can see the total payment requested was {$45.00}. The amount they paid me was {$53.00}. I deposited the check on XXXX. The claim with the post office was filed on XXXX and the dispute was opened well over a week later on XXXX. I figured Citibank would work directly with XXXX since they are an authorized postal location to verify that the package was lost. XXXX provided no supporting documentation other than the receipt. Did Citibank even provide XXXX with the reason for the dispute? They should have cross-referenced the tracking number and it would have resolved the problem. And, Citibank clearly could have taken the tracking number, entered it into USPS tracking, and found that I wasnt lying about the lost package. It is a legitimate dispute. XXXX also should have done more work on their end to resolve the problem and should have provided you with better documentation. Did you even alert them to the tracking number and my filed claim with the post office? It is really listed in the dispute. 

In addition, the notes the Citibank dispute employee has written dont even make grammatical sense. It looks borderline illiterate. Why is Citibank employing people that dont even know how to properly write a sentence? 

Finally, I literally dont understand why I wasnt notified about this problem months ago. I could have gotten Citibank supporting documentation of the claim with the post office. It is Citibank 's ethical responsibility to follow up on disputes. Then, when Citibank paid it out and I realized they ( XXXX ) were actually reimbursed for the postage as well and not cross referencing my dispute with Citibank, I could have withdrawn it. Why in the world would Citibank issue me a credit, also pay the merchant, and then take the amount and write it off? Why is Citibank issuing me a credit, then a conditional credit, then a permanent credit with no documentation required? This implies Citibank has followed up with the merchant and they agree with the dispute, which Citibank did and still failed to reverse it. And, if the Citibank employee coded that what I did was against the law, why on earth would Citibank not alert me to the problem? I listed it as goods not expected/received. You list examples of goods/services not as expected on your website as receiving something different than what was ordered, being unhappy with the service, the terms and conditions of the sale are not met, or ordering a specific brand and receiving counterfeit items. If a customer is doing something incorrectly, especially if you are going to say it is illegal, Citibank has an obligation to alert the customer and not let it pile up. If the package was not delivered as agreed under the conditions of priority mail, it is totally valid. The only reason why I even found out about this was when I withdrew every dispute with XXXX  for the year because I wanted them to take accountability for false advertising, not properly processing refunds, and failing to issue refunds. I have addressed this in another CFPB complaint, XXXX is reimbursing me within the next week, they are working on fixing the problems within the store, especially the problems within their meat department chain-wide. I went as far to go to three different stores, took pictures of every step, and e-mailed it all to their district manager. Now he also gets to deal with this...

Please reference the following previous CFPB complaints regarding the conversation with XXXX : XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. She was non-objective, accusatory, and totally rude. I am asking that the CFPB listen to the content of the conversation. 

I withdrew the disputes through their dispute summary online but also e-mailed billing disputes directly in case there was a problem, Citibank 's dispute summary was acting like it would take a withdrawal and then would reverse it. I had to go back through the account history several times to get several disputes to withdraw. 

After I withdrew the dispute, I received a letter from Citibank through the Notice 's and Letter 's page stating the {$5.00} was permanent as they received reimbursement from the merchant. They state I indicated in my letter that I wanted to dispute this with the merchant. They state they had already done that for me and had closed the investigation of the dispute and were not making any adjustments on the account. 

So, I told XXXX XXXX district manager that they didn't need to reimburse me for this charge. 

I just logged on to my Citibank account. On XX/XX/XXXX, a reversal for {$5.00} for XXXX  came through my account. It shows the original purchase date of XX/XX/XXXX. So despite what Citibank stated in writing, they reversed the charge.

So now, I have to revise my figure to the district manager. I am completely frustrated with how Citibank 's billing dispute department is handling this account. I am including all the supporting documentation for your records, which includes my withdraw, the follow-up e-mail to billing disputes, the dispute letter they issued through their Notice 's and Letter 's page dated XX/XX/XXXX, and the reversal they made on my account on XX/XX/XXXX.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",KS,660XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/12/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3529165

I pointed out to the representative that was not what I had been told when I cancelled the card, and noted that if I had known I would need to pay the annual fee regardless, I would have at least chosen to keep the card for the additional year to take advantage of the benefits. I also pointed out to the representative that no where in Citi 's Card Member Agreement do they define a specific timeline for how long a client has to request a refund after an annual fee posts to their account.

Both my mother and I have spent over 7 hours on the phone with Citi Bank on XX/XX/20 and XX/XX/20 respectively. We were transferred around endlessly between different departments, each saying they do not have the authority to process the request because my mother is on a repayment program, and I must talk to the department who last transferred us. It doesn't appear anyone at the company is capable of performing this routine function. 

Even though the account was closed nearly 3 years ago, they only started reporting my authorized user status to credit reporting agencies one month ago, which caused my credit score to drop 20 points in 30 days, so it is not a trivial matter. 

My belief is that Citibank wants to keep me as an authorized user and apply credit pressure in case my elderly mother dies or defaults on payments so that they can come after me, despite there being no legal justification for keeping me on the account that they can cite. Not only is the account closed, I haven't even had a physical card for this account or initiated a purchase on it in nearly 10 years. 

I don't believe they have the right to keep me on the account, or to continue reporting my involvement with the account to credit agencies after both the primary account holder and I have made more than reasonable attempts to sever my involvement with the account.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MN,551XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/20/20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3614213

The reason was vague, multiple choice and more of a form letter that anything specific. At the same time they canceled 3 flights of a set I was about to start taking on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I had accumulated XXXX miles in this XXXX account. This from a combination of credit card offers, direct spend on these credit cards and yes, some miles from 2 specific revenue flights. The flights that were canceled has cost an additional XXXX total from my XXXX account. 

On to the Citi part. From some internet research about this issue, it appears that XXXX  is doing this to many "" customers ''. The consensus is apparently that I obtained too many credit cards ( and associated bonus miles ) from Citi. Their belief is that using only Citi 's most strict rules, you can only get 3 or so credit cards in a 2 year period. Offers that Citi sends through the USPS mail have less strict restrictions and it is easy to obtain more than the limits XXXX  is applying. 

In short, Citi approved "" too many '' credit cards for me and Citi 's partner, XXXX XXXX, thought that my count was too high. Without warning or recourse, they closed my account. Citi provided me with generous credit card sign up bonuses that were subsequently taken away by their partner, XXXX. XXXX believes it can do anything it wants with its program and for any reason. Citi does not provide a warning during the application process and somehow happily allows customers to sign up for too many ( in XXXX  's eyes ).

The frustrating part about this is that Citi can claim it was XXXX  committing this foul, where XXXX   makes vague claims and the bottom line is it thinks Citi gave out too many credit cards with bonuses. 

I suspect XXXX  sold these miles to Citi. Citi issues them to me after meeting various financial obligations ( a significant cost to me ), then XXXX  takes them away? What kind of scam is this?

I have repeatedly tried to contact the post office about this problem through their website and by phone to find out why this wasn't properly delivered and I have not heard back from them.

She also replied to me through XXXX 's messaging system that my feedback was unfair and was going to be bad karma. I complained to XXXX  about removing my feedback and the seller 's unprofessional comments through messaging, and they apologized and stated they would directly address her behavior. I also filed a XXXX   report against XXXX for removing accurate feedback as well as an attorney general report with the state of California. I have had other issues with XXXX  as well much like this one. Through the XXXX, they also apologized and issued a {$10.00} credit for me to keep shopping with them.

I have e-mailed the supporting documentation for the refund to billing disputes on XX/XX/2020. I need Citibank to be clear that this dispute was not coded as mispresented. The seller clearly offered a refund, I had to dispute the item because of her tone ( I was concerned she wasn't going to issue the refund despite the agreement ), and either way, her negative feedback was removed. I literally can not believe she tried to renegotiate a better rating for removing the shipping fee. In addition, she can clearly obtain a refund on the shipping fee through the post office.

Plus, Citibank has been terrible with their dispute process on my account, so I need certainty. 

I am including all supporting documentation.

I requested a limit equal to that which I have on my American Express card, about double the current limit on my Costco Citi card. I have had the Citi card for several years and have a 100 % on-time, in-full payment history. 

On Citi 's website, it states : "" Once you submit your request, well need to obtain a credit bureau report. '' At no point, either in full-size or small print, does it provide that this inquiry will be a hard pull. I have recently requested my credit limits raised on other cards -- no company ever performed a hard pull. I consented to a soft pull of my credit report. I did not and would not have consented to a hard pull just to raise my credit limit. 

XXXX  's blog does a good job of laying out the commonly understood differences between hard pulls and soft pulls : "" A hard credit inquiry occurs when a potential lender examines your credit report and uses that information to decide whether to extend an offer for credit. For instance, if you apply for a home mortgage or a car loan, your lender will make a hard inquiry of your credit to help determine if you qualify for the loan. A soft credit inquiry, on the other hand, is a more routine check that can be done without your permission. A common example of a soft inquiry is when a lender youre currently doing business with checks your credit to make sure youre still creditworthy. You can also trigger a soft inquiry yourself if you check your own credit. '' ( https : //XXXX ) Citi is a bank with which I have a current business relationship. I was not applying for a new loan or mortgage with Citi, merely seeking to increase the credit on a preexisting credit card. When I accepted that Citi would look into my credit when considering an increase, it was based on the reasonable and commonplace understanding that a soft pull would be performed because of the context of the existing relationship. Citi has the lower barrier to avoid this kind of miscommunication, as Citi could easily modify the language on its website to specify the type of credit inquiry ( a hard pull, rather than a soft ) and could provide fine print regarding the ramifications of a hard pull to advise consumers. I have reviewed other complaints in the CFPB system and see that I am not the first Citi customer to have been surprised by a hard pull. 

As a result of Citi 's unauthorized hard pull, my credit has now dropped from "" excellent '' to "" good. '' This has occurred as we are trying to raise our credit to buy a home -- the only reason I was looking for a credit increase was to shrink my utilization ratio. I attempted to resolve the issue with Citi 's customer support, but unfortunately, the representatives were patronizing and not helpful. I am a reasonably informed consumer, with the additional benefit of having worked in contract law and with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The language as it stands on Citi 's website is not sufficient for consumers to provide informed consent for a hard credit pull.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,958XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/17/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3570289

I accepted to change of my personal checking account to XXXX. ' On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX processed an auto ACH for {$130.00} without any issues. On XX/XX/XXXX CITI attempted to withdraw an ACH in the amount of {$250.00} but it was denied. I was not notified until a week later ( XX/XX/XXXX ) when a CITI representative contacted me asking for a payment. I submitted a debit card transaction to CITI and contact XXXX to inquire about the reasoning behind the charge not going through. XXXX notified me that CITI processes ACH as paper checks ( first time I was aware ) and therefore rejected ( prior XXXX rep. told me not to worry as things will continue as is ). 

When I submitted my {$250.00} debit card payment to CITI on XX/XX/XXXX, I asked the representative if I have any other payment I must make, and he assured me all is up to date and no other payments are needed. 

**NOTE : I am on a pay-off payment plan with CITI since XX/XX/XXXX. They set me up on a no interest 60 month plan to pay off my debt. The agreed amount is {$250.00} due by the XXXX of every month. When I enrolled, my account was approaching late status, so I opted into this, and clarified with a representative if I have to pay off my late payment amount or focus on XXXX, the rep told me that I will NOT need to worry about the late payment and it will not affect my report to the credit bureau because I am now enrolled in a payment plan, so essentially pay XXXX starting the following XXXX and 30 days beyond that then it will be late ( I have a copy of the chat transcript with agent ID clearly stating not to worry about late payment reports ). 

In XXXX of XXXX, I was alerted that I have a late payment in my credit report from XX/XX/XXXX from CITI. I contacted CITI and they stated that my account was carrying the late payment balance from the moment I enrolled in XX/XX/XXXX, but the represntative never stated my account was ever late for the past 2 years ( it was hidden not even on the front end website ). Because this was carrying over apparently, 1 day past my due date and it triggered a late payment report. 

I disputed the to both CITI and three credit bureaus multiple times with sufficient evidence regarding my new checking account issue, chat transcript from CITI representative, but due to some fine print that I attempted to clarify with a representative ( who explicitly stated not to worry about late payments ) the report is considered accurate. 

I also then realized that as of today, the carry over balance of XXXX ( from XX/XX/XXXX ) is no longer in my account. Somehow my the balance was paid off, but other than the two payments ( XX/XX/XXXX which was 'rejected ' ) and XX/XX/XXXX I never made double payment. 

I checked my bank and see that it was indeed withdrawn and debited on the correct date, but CITI still shows it as returned. 

I then created a new dispute discussing how this carry over balance was no longer in my account because it was indeed debited on the correct date, but yet again they concluded the late payment as accurate.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,910XX,None,Consent provided,Web,06/01/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3677993

I just realized this in XXXX of 2019 when I was looking over my credit card statement through the Citi app on my phone. When I realized they have been charging me for this service I called and had them immediately cancel this service. I then asked them how long have they been charging my card for this and come to find it has been for almost 8-10 years. So I said I never signed up for this and would like them to refund me my money. This was my fault for not seeing this on my statement but then again I never have received a statement from them either. I just know when my payment due date is and always would call the number on my card and make my monthly payment. So long story short I called back and spoke to a manager who said that they will look into this and I will receive a letter in two weeks with their outcome. Well after doing this at least 4 times I did not get anywhere and kept getting the run around each time being transferred to a company in Texas that handles the Payment Safeguard. I asked them to provide proof of me signing up for this when at the time I probably had a {$100.00} balance in which I would not need any help with makign this payment due to the minimal amount of my payment. I can handle the low balance and I had job security so I never signed up for this service ever and it would of made no sense for me to do so to begin with. So to this date I keep going back and forth and the last response was that they could not provide proof of me signing up for this service. So my question is why do they not refund me all of the money if they can not prove I signed up. I did not sign up for this and am demanding a refund for all of those years of them charging me per month for a service I did not sign up for. It is a complete scam and have to say I am not happy one bit.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",OH,432XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/12/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3564820
03/09/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,You never received your bill or did not know a payment was due,"This complaint is in regards to CFPB complaints # XXXX & # XXXX. 
On XXXX XXXX 2019 I filed a complaint against Citi, # XXXX. The respondent, Ms. XXXX, claimed she was unable to contact me and labeled me a deadbeat which is discriminating. I immediately closed my account with CITI based on Ms. XXXX unjustified actions. 

On XXXX XXXX 2019 I filed another complaint against Citi, # XXXX. Ms. XXXX contacted me, was friendly and cooperative, and assisted me in determining the validity of two charges totaling approximately {$37.00}. Once confirmed I paid them with her over the phone but still questioned why I wasnt contacted about upcoming monthly payments. 

Ms. XXXX kindly waived the late fees but her letter dated XXXX XXXX 2019 indicated my account was being reported as 60 days overdue with the credit reporting companies even though she never mentioned this when we spoke. It appeared to be retaliatory for me closing my account. 

If Ms. XXXX had done her job and returned any of the TWO phone calls I made to her and had been as cooperative and helpful as Ms. XXXX, none of this would have happened and it was all over approximately {$37.00}. 

I am sure Citi noticed there are no late payment reports on my credit reports when they opened this account in XX/XX/2019 and for them to ruin my credit over {$37.00} after intentionally ignoring my phone calls and labeling me a deadbeat is unacceptable.

The website doesn't allow to make a payment that goes directly to the promotional balance without someone from the company doing it. It feels like they are not trying to to allow me to try and pay on it. I called again on XXXX and they replied "" I don't have specific information on this ''. When I asked for more help I was sent this message "" a promotional balance is a designated portion of your available credit that has a reduced introductory interest rate. Any balance you accrue up to the amount of the promotional balance is subject to a reduced interest rate.

I checked my account online and it said I was charged {$2500.00} in interest on XX/XX/XXXX  I immediately called and spoke to an agent to get this issue explained and resolved as they have a COVID-19 policy in place. The first agent was more than happy to assist saying that with the program there was a two month extension. I asked why I was charged so much and for what. She explained I bought a product during a promotion and the interest rate was 0 % for two years but that it was deferred. I explained that is not how the representative at the store explained the program to me at all. They said I had two years of 0 % and then I would pay interest on my balance thereafter. I was then transferred to a second agent who said she could put me in the program but that in order to get rid of the {$2500.00} interest charge I had to pay {$3400.00}. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Home Depot saying I was enrolled into the COVID-19 program and that any promotions would be extended by two months.

I asked her if I had been paying on my credit card, over the minimum balance, for two years why did my balance for my promotional purchase not decrease? She said that all my payments went to revolving purchases and interest and none of my two years worth of payments went towards my promotional purchase. Now two years later I owe exactly as much as I did when I purchased the product. I did not enroll into the promotion it was going on when I bought my product and there was never an option to opt out, the representative at the store was misleading and/or misinformed about the promotion, credit services did not put a single payment towards the promotional balance and credit services now refuses to help, even just for two months during a pandemic.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,935XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,05/27/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3670848

03/30/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Struggling to pay your bill,Credit card company won't work with you while you're going through financial hardship,"I have been on hold to with Shop Your Way Sears ( aka Citi ) to suspend my payments due to Corona related income reduction for about 3 hours. Someone finally picked up and told me that if I place my card on forbearance my account will be closed. I asked how long the forbearance would be for and she told me I could not be given that information unless I was willing to close my account and that it would not be reopened ever. She then put me on hold again with dead air appearing to make it look as though I'd been disconnected. Finally, she returned to tell me I was being put on hold again awaiting talking with an account manager. My experience with this makes it clear that this credit card company is resentful in providing forbearance as the subtext of the conversation is actually a threat of forbidding future credit and making it so onerous it would be seemingly impossible to get done without and extensive time investment. I do not think it is the intention of the Care Act to treat people as bad credit risks and or make it impossible to later procure credit and require enormous effort to exercise the benefits it offers. This credit card company needs to immediately institute and easily accessible online application, complete with all details of how long the forbearance will be and how the paused payments will be handled once the forbearance is over. While writing this I finally was given a person to speak with who then told me at this point I could have my account shut down with no information on what that would mean and how it would impact me or my credit or I could call back at some future date and wait on hold again for many hours to see if their management had made decisions and made actual forbearance options available.

I immediately contacted my Citibank to inform them that the charge was not me and to place a block on my card. I also attempted to contact Bloomingdale customer service on the same day to inform them of the fraudulent purchase. But was unsuccessful reaching someone because the company had been closed due to the Covid-19 situation. I tried calling everyday until I finally got someone from customer service today. Which was very unhelpful. I had to call the company 3 times trying to resolve this matter. But all three times the representatives would ask me for an order number on a purchase I never made. I received nothing but the run around from Bloomingdales. So I decided contacted Citibank again to file a dispute. And according to Citibank customer service rep it would be faster to contact the merchant and file a dispute with them. Because it's going to take up to 8 to 10 weeks to resolve the dispute with Citibank.

06/02/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Unexpected increase in interest rate,"I remember when the APR 's on my credit cards were all less than 10 %. Granted that was a long time ago, - before the establishment of the CFPB. I also remember during the Great Recession after the Banking Reform Act was passed, that fees for late payments and insufficient funds at my credit union were less than {$10.00} per incident and had limitations as to how many times in one business day a consumer could be fined. Over the years, all of those fees have crept back up to the inflated absurd levels typical of banks and credit unions today. 

So, my complaint is not really about a particular incident, but is a general complaint that credit card interest rates are crazy absurdly high -- when the Fed rate is at zero. Now that my business is vastly diminished due to a global pandemic, I called customer service for each of my three credit cards ( XXXX XXXX XXXX card, XXXX MC card, and Citi Diamond Preferred MC card ) asking for a reduction in the APRs, which are at 21 %, 18 %, and 20 % respectively, -- and was simply told "" no ''. Made a second round of calls, explaining that I was close to my credit limits due to having to use them to pay rent, buy food, and pay bills, and I asked to speak with managers. 

Given that all three institutions have public statements about helping clients, I don't think my request was entirely beyond reason. Even one or two percentage points for a temporary period of time would have assuaged my anger, but I was not even offered a review, a "" maybe '', or "" let us get back to you ''. One card offered to enroll me in a "" special program '' specially designed to help customers get through the pandemic. There was the reading of the small print, and the do-you-understand-your-responsibilities as if I was signing my life away ... and all their vaunted special program did was cancel the late payment fee. Nothing more. I have had all three cards since XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX respectively and maybe a dozen late payments between the three over all these years ... until recently. The penalty now for a late payment is a hike in your APR -- in addition to the {$25.00} or {$30.00} late fee -- with no consideration at all for previous early payments, double payments, or even having no balance at all. 

These policies have nothing to do with discipline, customer responsibilities, or incentives because I have reviewed much research on this issue prior to breaking with my credit union in XXXX. They are simply trying to maximize their profits with policies that they can get away with now that regulating bank practices is less of a political priority. 

My credit score has always been well above XXXX, I have paid off mortgages, student loans, credit cards that I thought were rip-offs, a truck ; I have never been evicted, never failed to pay rent ( even if I had to use a credit card to do so ), never any legal problems, never lost my driver 's license ; I have paid all my taxes, and have generally been financially responsible -- but now when I have had to use my credit cards under duress, I am finding myself in a hole that seemed manageable at first ... and yet turned out to have quicksand at the bottom. 

These absurdly high APR 's are predatory, as are the policies around late fees, penalties, stonewalling clients like me who are asking for APR reductions, and are inconsistent with their public narrative of "" helping '' their clients or consumers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Please do your jobs and rein in these abusive banking practices, before so much more damage is done.

So, the payment did not process and the credit card company put a "" hold '' on our account. This 6-month "" hold '' has created the following problems with our account : 1.

06/11/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I just submitted a complaint against American Express Macy 's Credit Card, which is Department Stores National Bank. The previous Complaint did not address any of my concerns, and a new issue has come up as of last night. I am hereby filing a new and supplemental complaint against American Express Macy 's Credit Card, which is Department Stores National Bank. 

Curious how Macy 's seems to be affected by Covid only when it comes to responding to their client 's concerns, but have no problem selling their retail. And they show little regard to their customers of almost forty ( 40 ) years, as in my case. 

I am a XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, and I have been addressing consumer grievances for many years. Covid has not kept me from continuing to assist the good people of California as they need a consumer agency which is there for them. 

Their response from their employee, XXXX XXXX Macy 's Executive Office XXXX Extension XXXX was a non-response. In fact, it was hurtful by how non-humane her response was. 

Her response was limited to a spreadsheet of the credits made. I did not ask for, nor did I need a recap of what has and has not been credited by Macy 's. I have access to online activity. Recapping the online activity which I have access to, did not address any of my concerns and did not offer any solutions. 

Asking me to call another Department ( the Executive Office for Macys.com order department for further assistance who can be reached by calling XXXX ), was discourteous and dismissive, and appeared was a boiler-plate response. 

If she needed more information on the items returned, adjustments requested and dirty underwear   delivered to me by them, Macy 's has multiple emails from me regarding these various issues which she has access to, As with anything else pertaining to my account. 

Ms. XXXX not only did not address the issues, she did not even at minimum, forward my grievance to the Executive Office, to have THEM address my concerns with courtesy, and have them resolve my issues. 

Regarding the new health risk issue which occurred yesterday. Macy 's delivered a set of earphones which had also been previously sold as new ( as with previous items noted by me, but not addressed by Ms. XXXX ). The earphone package had been opened, used and re-packaged, delivered incomplete and sold as new. The earphone is equipment which is placed in a human ear. This time, Macy 's outdid itself. A pair of earphones trumps used underwear. 

Hence, my issues remain unresolved. I still have not received credit for previously returned items, and one of those items includes a XXXX  watch for {$120.00}, I was credited {$10.00} for an item which I paid {$53.00}, are only a few examples of what I have written directly to Macy 's about. 

I also have not received price adjustments which have been requested several times. 

But what is worse, Macy 's has not addressed the used underwear issue and now, they are sending used earphones to their clients, such as the ones delivered to me yesterday. 

CFPB, do I need to report Macy 's to the CDC? To the Department of Labor, to the State Attorney, the FTC? 

Help us please. Which agency regulates their behavior during Covid and their irresponsible acts, such as delivering used underwear and used earphones to their clients. 

What exactly is Macy 's obligation not only to you, as a Federal Consumer Protection Agency Regulator, in addressing complaints, but also to me, the consumer? Because they did not address my concerns.

Citi handled these disputes completely differently, and this dispute is regarding the way in which Citi has handled dispute # XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email stating that they received the dispute XXXX, this email made no requests for information or even a detailed reason for my dispute. The next email I received came on XX/XX/XXXX. It said that they contacted the merchant and would let me know if they needed anything further.

I was told that I could send the information via email and that it would be attached to my dispute. I sent all of the information that was requested for the other dispute in for the dispute in this complaint # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. This information included statements from 4 different experts regarding the issues with the floor, a transcript of all the text communication between myself and the merchant ( including the text where he stated that he would not be honoring the warranty ), all email communication, the contract, warranty, terms and conditions, photos of the issues with the floor, and a detailed account of the reason for my dispute. All the information that I sent was the same that was sent for the other dispute, however on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice in my account stating that the investigation for the dispute in this complaint ( XXXX ) had been closed based on the information they had available. The notice stated that if I wanted to continue the dispute that I would need to return the signed letter as well as a review from a similar merchant saying what was done incorrectly and proof of what was expected vs. what was received. I contacted Citi dispute customer service again via phone on XX/XX/XXXX. The agent looked into the account and verified that all the required documentation was there. He told me that he would be making a note on my account so that the investigator would look back and find the information. He instructed me to send in the signed letter via email and write a note explaining that the information had already been sent. I called back in and spoke with another agent to verify that this was all that was needed, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I sent in the signed letter with notations as instructed. I contacted Citi dispute center again on XX/XX/XXXX to make sure the letter was received and to verify that nothing further was needed and was told that everything was as it should be. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice in my account stating that my dispute had been reviewed and that they would not be able to assist because they did not have a letter from a similar merchant stating that the work performed by the original merchant was incorrectly or unnecessarily performed. I provided statements from 4 different similar merchants stating what was wrong with the floor and why it needed to be redone. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice in my account for the other dispute ( XXXX ) stating that they were continuing to try to obtain a permanent credit. Both disputes are for the same service and I have provided all of the same information. I do not believe the dispute in this complaint ( XXXX ) is being handled correctly.

03/26/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"On XX/XX/2020, I was physically assaulted and robbed. The two robbers knocked me out and stole my wallet amongst other items. 

One of the cards in my wallet was a Best Buy Citi Visa Card which they used to make 2 purchases. 

XX/XX/XXXX. - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$260.00} XX/XX/XXXX. - XXXX - {$23.00} Total : {$290.00} I disputed these charges on XXXX or XXXX ; however, the company took multiple weeks to process the dispute refunds. 

My regular purchase balance was {$1000.00} and my additional purchases for that month including the fraudulent charges totaled {$530.00}. 

I paid {$1400.00} towards that balance, so XXXX + XXXX - XXXX = {$190.00} Since I did not pay the full balance, I was charged {$15.00} in interest. 

However, had they processed the dispute in a timely manner like all my other credit cards, or been responsible in their billing and not included the disputed amount in my balance, then I actually paid more than what was due. The card does have 0 interest amount that the extra amount was meant to pay down. 

Therefore, XXXX + XXXX - XXXX ( disputed ) - XXXX = XXXX This shows that I paid more than the regular interest balance had the disputed transactions ( which were eventually refunded ), not been included in the regular interest calculations. 

I am requesting a refund of {$15.00} in interest charged as a result of their error. 

I did file a claim with the company a couple weeks ago, and I have not heard back. The interest fee has yet to be refunded. 

I have attempted to contact their security ops department to follow up, but the hold time is too long.

03/13/20,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I filed a complaint against on XX/XX/20. From Citibank reply, I learned that my credit report was checked for a credit line increase that I didn't authorize. I have a freeze and fraud alert on all three credit files. This complaint also consist of XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX  releasing my credit reports without consent. 

The following are issues that Citibank needs to answer that were unanswered in the first complaint and prompt additional complaints. 
-- -- - ( 1 ). Why was an unknown email placed on my account without verification? My email address has always been XXXX. 
-- -- - ( 2 ). Why was my account reported to all three credit bureau agencies as delinquent? There were no delinquencies. Through automatic payment from an account that I no longer used, three payments were returned. I replaced the drafted payments, and I was charged return check fees, not late fees. The credit bureaus do not report return checks on accounts. It reports late payments. The account was paid in a timely manner. By law, I am supposed to be given time to pay for any return check payments. 
-- This unfair credit reporting violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act and debt collection. I will file a complaint with my State 's Attorney General Office for an investigation, and I will file a federal lawsuit if necessary to resolve this matter. As a result of Citibank inaccurate reporting my account as late, my credit score was lowered to XXXX. 
-- -- - ( 3 ). Why was my credit line decreased based on other creditors? I've never paid any of my creditors late.

-- My credit score has been negatively effected in terms of a low score of XXXX because Citibank lowered the credit line, which indicates to creditors that I used nearly 100 % of the credit lin, which is inaccurate. This is abusive credit card practice.

-- -- - ( 4 ). In a tape recorded conversation, the representative indicated that Citibank would removed the return check fees due to my hospitalization. 
-- -- - ( 5 ). If Citibank attempted to contact me about the return payments, I would've been unable to answer the calls at my home resident. Beside my home phone number, my account provided a cell phone number. I never received any voicemail messages on my cell phone from Citibank notifying me of return payments, nor did I receive any letters. 
-- -- - ( 6 ). Citibank claimed that emails were sent to me at XXXX. This fraudulent email never belonged to me, and the name alone should've alerted Citibank of an account breach. Most importantly, I was never notified to verify a change in my email address. 
-- -- - ( 7 ). There has been security breaches with Citibank and XXXX. I question how Citibank accessed my credit report files with a freeze and a permanent fraud alert. I have not removed the freeze in over a year. 
-- If Citibank doesn't resolve my issues of concern, and my credit files doesn't report accurate information. I will be hiring an attorney to take legal measures for a resolution.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",SC,291XX,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,03/13/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3565591

04/29/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Credit card company won't increase or decrease your credit limit,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a 0 % Citibank credit card account, in order to transfer some of my higher balances. The credit limit was {$4500.00}. I transferred balances and since opening the account, I have paid every payment on time. There have been times that I paid over what was due to bring down my balance. Without my asking, Citibank increased my credit limit to {$8200.00}, I believe in late XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, they again increased my credit limit to {$8700.00}. 

I have not used the card since XX/XX/XXXX, because I wanted to bring my usage percentage down. My current balance is {$4600.00}. With a credit limit of {$8700.00}, my usage percentage was about 53 %. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a XXXX XXXX alert, stating that Citibank had lowered my credit limit to {$4900.00}! Owing {$4600.00}. on a {$4900.00}, credit limit increased my usage on the card to 94 %!! 

I called Citibank and the agent told me that I was sent a notice via USPS on XX/XX/XXXX. I haven't received it. But I also moved to a new house. 

I asked the agent why Citibank lowered my limit. She stated that my credit usage was too high overall. I explained that my usage has only increased by a little, over the past few years, and asked why the limit wasn't lowered before. For this, she had no answer. I also explained that I have paid all of my credit cards on time, and almost always pay over what it due on each card. ( I monitor my credit score every month! ) I complained to the agent that we are in the middle of a Pandemic, and many people are not working and have to use their credit cards for present. I stated that all over social media, Citibank has bragged that they are helping customers, who are having trouble making their credit card or loan payments by using deferment, credit limit increases and other methods. At the same time, they have lowered my credit limit. I have not asked for their help with my payments, and have continued to pay what is due during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

I feel that Citibank has unfairly taken advantage of customers like me, who haven't asked for help and who continue to pay their credit card bill during this crisis. Their action in lowering my credit limit has set a precedent for my other credit card companies to do the same. This would wreak havoc on my credit score, which will sorely disable me for my future. 

As it stands, due to Citibank 's harsh decision, I learned on XX/XX/XXXX that my credit score went down 27 points this month!!! I am totally disheartened, as I have worked so hard to build my credit since my divorce from a financially irresponsible husband! 
I ask : Why bother paying my credit cards on time and pay extra, if I am going to be penalized unjustly anyway? I wouldn't even have lost that many points on my credit score if I paid one, two or maybe three payments late! Would I have been better off, if I had asked Citibank to help me with my payments, rather than continue to pay on time? I don't know. But lowering my credit limit is very unfair and hurts me and my family. 

I read Citibank 's many reviews and saw that during this pandemic, their overall rating is one star. I saw that a few other consumers have suffered the same fate as I have. All of the reviews were from disgruntled customers. I am also going to write a review. 

I received no satisfaction from my call to Citibank to resolve the issue. The agent told me that the only thing I could do was to contact XXXX, where they received my information. That same information has been there all along, since I opened the card. Why lower my credit limit now? I will contact XXXX. But XXXX  did not make the decision to lower my credit limit, Citibank did!! 

I appreciate your assistance in helping to resolve this issue and ultimately, get my credit score back up and in good standing.

I opened up my first and only Citibank Citi ThankYou Preferred Visa sometime in XXXX and have been a loyal customer with an exemplary credit history. In the 28 plus years of being a Citi Cards Citibank Citi ThankYou Preferred Visa loyal customer, I maintained an excellent payment history, never had a missed payment, never exceeded my credit limit nor had any other type of issues with them until recently. 

Sometime in XX/XX/XXXX, my Costco XXXX XXXX credit card account automatically transferred me into a Citibank Citi Cards Costco Anywhere Visa account being that Costco no longer was conducting business with XXXX XXXX. I was then issued a Citi Cards Costco Anywhere Visa Credit Card number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as part of Costco 's transition. 

With that said, i continued to maintain both credit cards in exceptional standing. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Citi Cards to see if they can either combine my two credit card accounts into one as opposed to having two separate Citi Cards Visa Credit Card accounts or request if they can lower my interest rate as they were both above 16 % interest rates respectfully. During our telephone conversation they stated that they can not lower either of my interest rates nor can they combine both cards into one account. 

The representative/account specialist offerred me the option to put me on a 60 month payment arrangement plan with a 9.9 % fixed rate and no penalty on my Citibank Citi ThankYou Preferred Visa account. In addition, I was told that my Citibank Citi Cards Costco Anywhere Visa account would remain the same and the payment arrangement would not affect my credit report because my account is "" not delinquent and is not past due on their records ''. I agreed to the payment arrangement plan effective XX/XX/XXXX and have been paying faithfully and on time it since without any issues. I received a follow up letter dated XX/XX/XXXX for the payment arrangement plan. ( See Attachment # 1 ) On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I received an email from XXXX stating that "" Your credit card account will be closed '' for my Citibank Citi Cards Costco Anywhere Visa card without any reason listed in the body of the email why they were closing my account. ( See attachment # 2 ) It also stated "" You have a new message '' in my "" Statements and Communications Center '' but no message was found when I accessed the feature in the  Citicards app. 

The following business day, XX/XX/XXXX, I checked the "" Statements and Communications Center '' feature again in my Citi Cards app but no message was found about why my account was closed. I proceeded to call the Citibank Citi Cards Costco Anywhere Visa phone number listed in the body of XX/XX/XXXX email ( XXXX ) and the representative replied that he could not give me the reason why my account was being closed other than "" wait for your letter in the mail ''. I ended my call and panicked because I could not understand why they were closing my one and only credit card.

I also called my Costco Wholesale Membership number to report my issue to them about my credit card account and they could not believe that my Citibank Citi Cards Costco Anywhere Visa was being closed unexpectedly nor could they help me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, sometime during late afternoon/evening hours, I accessed "" Statements and Communications Center '' feature again in my Citi Cards app and noticed the letter was posted. ( See Attachment # 3 ). The letter stated "" Your account will be closed ''. The first paragraph stated : "" Hi, XXXX. We reviewed your Costco Anywhere Visa account since it's expiring soon. We're unable to issue you a new card because you're currently enrolled in repayment program for this account or another credit card issued by Citi. 

I was totally blind-sided by this and could not understand why I was not made aware of this when I first signed up for the payment arrangement plan with Citibank Citi ThankYou Preferred Visa account. This left me without any credit cards. I made numerous calls to Citibank Citi Cards requesting an explanation on why I was not warned ahead of time and worried that this would affect my Costco Warehouse membership. Surely, would I have known this was going to happen, then I would of left my Citibank Citi ThankYou Preferred Visa account open.

Prior to this, I maintained an exceptional FICO credit score and credit report. My FICO credit score dropped dramatically because of Citibank Citi Cards actions. In addition, I was told by a Costco Warehouse Membership services that I will all lose my accumulated Costco Cash Rewards earned to date in the amount of {$130.00}. To add insult to injury I am unable to obtain a new credit card after being declined by XXXX and XXXX bank institutions because of Citibank Citi Cards actions. 

To make matters worse, on XX/XX/XXXX Citibank Citi Cards mailed me a letter received on XX/XX/XXXX stating that "" Your account terms are changing ''. The body of the letter states that they will be penalizing me with a "" Penalty APR '' effective XX/XX/XXXX billing cycle increasing my minimum payment due on my account with a 29.99 % APR. Once again, they initially told me when I signed up for the payment arrangement plan on XX/XX/XXXX, I will not receive any penalty as a result of my payment arrangement. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I called Citibank Citi Cards : ( XXXX ) in an attempt to resolve my account issues and the representative "" XXXX '' could not help me. XXXX stated that my account was closed back on XX/XX/XXXX and I was not made aware of anything until XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX transferred me to an Accounts Manager named "" XXXX '' who clearly stated that there is "" NOTHING HE CAN DO NOR CAN HE CHANGE ANYTHING ''. I ended my call without any resolution. 

Bottom line is my credit card was not shut down for any bad reasons. Citibank Citi Cards destroyed my credit report and credit score without giving me any advanced notice so that we could move forward with a resolution. There is a strong possibility that they have ruined my reputation with Costco Warehouse. I am now without a credit card, lost a significant amount of points on my FICO credit score, lost my Costco cash rewards and unable to obtain any new credit card accounts. 

I would appreciate if your agency can investigate Citibank Citi Cards and have them reinstate or restore my credit score. In addition, I do not believe that it is fair that they are penalizing me with a "" Penalty APR '' of 29.99 % on my Citibank Citi Cards Costco Anywhere Visa. I have maintained a polished credit report for over 28 plus years and Citibank Citi Cards tarnished my report.

Your help and efforts is greatly appreciated in pursuing this investigation of Citibank Citi Cards financial institution especially during these challenging times of the Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Citi concerning the charge and the merchant 's failure to provide the order. I received a response from Citi dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating that the merchant disclosed proof from XXXX that I signed for the package. ( See attached as Exhibit A ). This information was false and misleading. On XX/XX/XXXX, I replied to Citi with additional information from XXXX indicating that the package may have been  delivered but without signature as the merchant did not ship the package with a signature requirement, ( See attached as Exhibit B ). As such, I requested an internal review of charge, dispute process and further inquiry. In the interim, I made good faith payments to my account with Citi in an effort to avoid delinquency and fees. In addition I requested that all fees and penalties on the disputed amount be reversed.

02/21/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Account opened as a result of fraud,"Citibank deceptively and fraudulently sent me multiple offers for the same promotion to open up a new checking account. I previously had zero checking accounts but have 2 credit card accounts ( Citi Prestige and Citi Premier ). Over the last 6 months I have spent about {$200000.00} on those accounts. The offer was the following : 1 ) Open up a new Citi checking account 2 ) Make debit card purchase ( s ) of at least {$750.00} in the first 60 days 3 ) Use online bill pay to the same merchant at least two consecutive months in the first 60 days I used the Citibank email ( that I attached a screen shot of ) that had a "" GET STARTED '' link to then open up the page to open the Citibank Priority account that had the promotion connected to that link. I completed all the information requested and my account was opened on XX/XX/XXXX ( email attached showing confirmation opening the account ). I then proceeded to fulfill all the requirements to satisfy the promotion. Here are the dates and amounts of the transactions ( Account snapshot ) attached : 1 ) XX/XX/XXXX : Funded account with {$2000.00} 2 ) XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX online bill payment for {$35.00} 3 ) XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX bill payment for {$750.00} 4 ) XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX online bill payment for {$35.00} I even call Citi at the end of XXXX to confirm that my account was setup and confirm I had fulfilled all the requirements except needing one more online bill payment ( which I fulled on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I then patiently waited for my XXXX bonus points to be transferred to my account which did not get transferred. I called Citi on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with a supervisor named XXXX ( her team # is XXXX ). She said she would escalate the review. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Citi ( attached ) stating "" You've earned your Thank You Points! You've successfully completed the required activities for your special Citi Offer. We'll credit your ThankYou Points to your account within 30 days ''. 

After receiving this email, I believed that everything was fine and would be credited the points to my account. However, I received a follow up letter today XX/XX/XXXX stating, "" Unfortunately, there was not a ThankYou promotion offered in conjunction with the opening of your account. While Citi does offer ThankYou promotions at times, those offers are only available to the individual to whom the offer was addressed ''. 

After receiving this letter today, I called back and requested to speak to a supervisor and spoke with XXXX ( Team # XXXX ). She was completely unhelpful and would only read what was in the letter. I also filed a written complaint with Citibank today as well to further document what happened. 

Here is a recap : 1 ) I used the Citibank promotional email and link to open the checking account. 
2 ) I satisfied all the requirements to receive the promotional reward 3 ) I received confirmation from Citibank in XXXX that there was only one last step needed to complete the reward. 
4 ) I received confirmation from Citibank that I had satisfied all the requirements of the reward 5 ) Citibank today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) sent me a letter stating I do not qualify for the reward. 

This is clearly deceptive and fraudulent business practices that remind me of the practices of XXXX XXXX in order to profit unscrupulously from their customers. This fraud should not be tolerated by the government and ask that the government to intervene to ensure that Citibank resolve this issue and prevent it from this further fraud. 

Here is a recap of the documents submitted in conjunction with this complaint : 1 ) Citibank emailed me at XXXX and addressed to me personally dated XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  with the offer referenced in this complaint 2 ) Pictures of the mailed offer Citibank addressed and sent me for this same promotional offer 3 ) Screenshot of the account activity that I satisfied all three requirements of the promotion which again were : 1 ) open an account by XX/XX/XXXX, 2 ) Spend {$750.00} on my Citi debit card, and 3 ) make 1 qualifying bill payment for 2 consecutive months within the same 60 day window 4 ) Email from Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX confirming I had invite completed all the requirements of the Citibank Offer 5 ) Copy of the Citibank letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating I was denied now the XXXX ThankYou Points because Citi claims I never received an offer for this promotion 6 ) Copy of formal complaint with Citibank about this issue",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,945XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/21/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3539998

06/09/20,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Opening an account,Didn't receive terms that were advertised,"On XXXX, I opened a "" High-Yield '' savings account with Citibank by clicking through an offer provided to me in the Citibank mobile application. As shown in the attached screenshot, the rate that was advertised to me was 1.6 %. I had to call Citibank Customer Service later that day on an unrelated issue and asked them to confirm the interest rate since the online banking portal showed a rate of 0 % on the new account. They told me that they thought the rate would be 1.55 %, but that they could not be sure because the account was so new ( a few hours old ) and asked me to call back the next day to confirm. Because of the apparent discrepancy, I went back to the mobile app and took a screenshot showing that 1.6 % was being advertised. When I checked back the next day, they confirmed that the rate was not what I had been shown. After a few days of getting nowhere with their customer support, they finally opened a "" request '' on my behalf on XX/XX/XXXX to investigate the issue. On XX/XX/XXXX, they responded with a letter saying "" We reviewed our record 's [ sic ], as per our research interest rate is 1.40 %.

02/29/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"Citi Diamond Preferred Account ending in XXXX Citi Reference Number : XXXX Citibank , N.A . 
Office of the President XXXX. XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, SD XXXX RE : Account Fraud, Citibank Errors and violations. 

Greetings, I write to you today in response to your last communication sent on XX/XX/2020. 
There are several errors in your stated response. First, you state the charge was billed on XX/XX/2020 to the card ending in XXXX. This is an error, as the card ending in XXXX was manually entered and charged by XXXX. However, the card ending in XXXX had been closed and reported stolen in XXXX. My security preferences were also changed on XX/XX/2020. Citi has stated it did not have those records, only to later state they found them. If you are still having difficulty in finding these notes, Im more than happy to send you the call recording on XX/XX/2020 around XXXX XXXX CST. You make reference to your Automatic Billing Updater Service, and place blame on this service for allowing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for being able to charge my card {$1700.00}. This is an erroneous explanation. Upon a card being reported as stolen the Automatic Billing Updated Service is halted and returns a card stolen message to any merchant trying to charge the compromised card. Also, the charge with XXXX was part of an automatic billing service. This is further proven by XXXX transaction log for my card which shows the stolen card to be manually entered. 

You continue to state I received a conditional credit for the XXXX charge in question. I did receive a credit, which was reversed and charged back to me prior to you sending me your response on XX/XX/2020. As such its unclear why you would claim I received a credit for this fraudulent charge. You state XX/XX/XXXX, as the deadline to hear back from me before you consider the charge to be valid. However, I have called and written in for the past few months almost every day to get this corrected. The problem lies with your Security Operations team, who upon being contacted inform me I need to write in to the Office of the President as they are unable to assist. This creates a major problem, when Im told to call in, only to be told to write in when I do. It results in nothing being done. I did finally speak with one of your agents who conferenced in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to determine the validity of the charges. XXXX confirmed with your representative that they do not reflect the charges as shown on my statements. As such your security officer stated she would be issuing a security credit for the charges. 

While Citi has stated it would or has issued credits for the fraudulent charges or billing errors, I have yet to see this be reflected on the amount due. This is rather odd as on XX/XX/2020 Citi sent me an email stating my amount due was reduced to take my disputed transactions into account. Yet, the new minimum amount due does not include all the disputed transactions. Despite already supplying Citi with the case number created by the local law enforcement. Citi has repeatedly approved transactions on stolen cards when manually entered. Citi has also repeatedly approved transactions despite the account already being way over the credit limit due to Citi failing to correct billing errors and fraudulent transactions. 

Lastly, I was informed today over the phone Citi has closed my account. But was unable to provide an explanation. While this account was closed the fraudulent transactions, which have yet to be corrected for months are almost {$7000.00}. I have repeatedly made written and oral requests for all related documents, but have yet to receive them. 

I request the following disputed charges and billing errors be corrected immediately and my account be re-instated in good standing as all these errors were caused by Citi. Errors, which Citi has been refusing to correct. Additionally, the current charges shown on my closed account information still states {$10000.00} which includes a fraudulent transaction of $ 3,700+ which is included in the account balance, but not shown on any statement or shown online. 

I have literally spent hundreds of hours on hold with Citi attempting to correct these many errors. I have provided Citi with police reports and complaints filed with the Justice Dept and State Atty General, evidence in the form of corrected billing statements and more. Yet I have only been given false promises and hopes Citi will correct their errors. Which has led to the improper closure of my account by Citi as a result.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",TX,78723,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,02/29/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3549360

06/01/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"Hello, I have an issue with Credit Protection fees related to my Bloomingdales store card. 

I signed up for the Bloomingdale 's credit card as an active credit line and I was told that an added benefit of having this card was the credit protection - there wasn't a clear disclosure that this would be a month-to-month service. I have a card that provides this service free of charge so the incorrect conclusion was that it would be similar. 

I took a look at my Bloomingdales statement and found a credit protection service with the following : FEES Transaction Date : XX/XX/XXXX Description : CREDIT PRO XXXX Amount : {$17.00} Bloomingdale 's customer service provided a high-level summary of this charge and confirmed they could not cancel the service because it's a separate entity. 

I called the XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX number for more information and to cancel. That process required additional effort ... 

1. A voice message appears letting you know about long wait times, I was a bit discouraged but decided to stick to with the call. 

2. The second message lists out options incl. terminating the service ( # 3 ). I was prompted to enter the last 4 numbers on the account. Try it for yourselves, the "" system '' doesn't recognize the input. I did this on both landline and cell phones. I kept inputting the numbers and message that I hadn't entered a number. I was finally connected to a representative. 

After introductions, I asked the representative the following questions : 1. What is this service about? Rep said this is credit protection plan in addition it will pay the minimum balance on your bill in case you lose your job ... 

2. What's the website? I'd like to see the benefits. "" No, we don't have a website. You may request more information by faxing us at XXXX and please include a cover on your faxed request. Requests take 5-7 business days to process. '' 3. How do consumers know what's included in this service? "" We mail the information out one time, so individuals are aware after they sign up. '' 4. Please detail the terms and conditions. "" Please send us a fax and we'll be glad to help ''. 

5. Are you affiliated with Bloomingdales? "" No, we're not affiliated. We provide the service to the cardholders ''. 

I'm writing to CFPB because the process of obtaining information was arduous. 

1 ) I'm signing up for a PAID SERVICE, that was described to me as a card benefit ( no monthly fee is disclosed ). 

2 ) The initial process of reaching a representative is not easy and I was dissuaded from continuing. I'm sure working folks, who have limited time, may not have cancelled as a result. 

3 ) Getting information is made even more difficult by having to fax ( not email but fax ) in requests of the services ; which undoubtedly will make folks rethink and continuing paying. 

4 ) The {$17.00} becomes part of my Bloomingdales principal balance. If this is your only payment, minimum payment, you get hit with a {$38.00} late fee. If you don't keep tabs on your account, this can accrue rapidly over time - especially with a 25.24 % APR.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,112XX,None,Consent provided,Web,06/01/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3678069

I needed it ASAP so they canceled the order and refunded me the money of the dishwasher and delivery fee 100 %. 

However, they charged me a {$140.00} restocking fee. They did not have the product in-stock to be able to restock it. I really wanted the dishwasher, which is why I bought it, but they ultimately did not have it. 

Also, they had me sign-up for the Sears Shop Your Way Mastercard to get a discount. So I did. After they refunded me the money, I received a credit card statement with the {$140.00} charge. I disputed that with Mastercard. A couple of months later I found out that they sided with Sears on the restocking fee.

XXXX {$210.00} XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) 2.  XXXX {$440.00} XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) 3. XXXX {$4.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ) 4. XXXX XXXX   {$120.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ) 5. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$77.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ) 6. XXXX {$250.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ) On the same day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I communicated to the bank and raised a dispute of all the above mentioned charges. I also went to the extent of contacting all the merchants via email and letting them about the transaction and requested them not to proceed with the shipment ; and where the shipment was out of their warehouse I asked them to put a hold on the delivery. To my surprise, all the merchants asked me to work with the bank and they were not exploring the option of holding back the shipment. 

While working with the bank, my credit card issuer, I had to contact them multiple times asking the team to post a temporary credit to reduce the credit card outstanding amount so that I only pay the charges that I recognize. 

Fast forward, it is XXXX and today I checked to see the status of the disputes. I was surprised to see the first disputed charge {$210.00} was closed in favor of the merchant. 

My credit card issuer is Citi bank and as this is an online fraudulent transaction I would expect the issuer to pick up this charge and treat is as fraud loss, not to bill the customer. Ideally, I would expect customers to be notified if there is an odd purchase, for instance, XXXX  is a XXXX website, and going by the transaction history I have not bought goods/services outside of US I would have expected Citi to flag this transaction.

Citibank ended closing the account not letting me make another payment or chance to react and go ahead and close my account. I been making my payments every month but the last payment did not go through Not giving me a chance to make another payment. The problem here is that this is going to greatly affect my credit score or my ability to find housing or refi my auto loan and many other things that I can do with my credit. Citibank obviously jeopardizes peoples credit their up to make their own profit not caring about consumers situations or hardships not offering absolutely anything any help offer the been operating deceptive practices like bait and switch strategy from them offering false advertising with great credit card deals and another perk like miles discounts, etc The reality is completely different there high-interest rates are above any other credit card that I consider a predatory lending company and theyre up to their own profit not to help people at all with hardships like unemployment XXXX in another kind of hardship. 

I like to dispute the matter of how my account is going to reflect on my credit they have the power to remove that and I will continue making my payment but I want to report that this is really an ethical what they do it can be legal but it really does not help the customers at all Thank you.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,921XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/03/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3518280

XX/XX/2020 - I filed disputes related with Citi credit card for all XXXX charges because I was fearful XXXX wasn't going to refund. Citi is investigating ( note that all charges concerning trip were paid off in full late XX/XX/2020 ), but, now it appears they ( Citi ) are holding my money. 

XX/XX/2020 - the only charge that was made from my personal checking account to XXXX for a spa treatment for my significant other was refunded in the amount of {$79.00}. This tells me they ( XXXX ) are in the act of refunding. I then called XXXX and they gave me itemized list via phone for all charges and said they were refunded late XX/XX/2020 early XX/XX/2020. The representative also told me that the bank ( Citi ) was now supposed to be streamlining this process. I am currently trying to get proof of refund from XXXX through documentation. 
Citi said they have received no payment from XXXX 's bank and I am hearing the same thing over and over from them ( I have 15 pages of documentation of correspondence through Cit 's messenger app. ) I have contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Citi, US DOJ, South Carolina Attorney General, and CFPB.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",SC,295XX,None,Consent provided,Web,05/09/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3644015

A promotional balance transfer was offered to me over the Citibank website, 0 % APR until XX/XX/XXXX with 3 % origination fee. I called Citibank on or about XX/XX/XXXX to ask whether I could request this balance transfer on my current card. The terms indicated that if I make continued purchases with the card, I would continue to have the 29.99 % APR applied. 

I called to clarify whether this was creating a new account or whether this would be applied to my current card ( where, as explained, I would not be able to continue to purchase goods without accruing interest ). The associate on the phone did not speak English well, so I had to rephrase my questions several times. Ultimately, she explained that no, I would not accrue interest as long as I paid off my purchases month-to-month, while keeping the balance of the balance transfer there. 

I processed my balance transfer on XX/XX/XXXX and subsequently checked my online account. My account balance after it was processed included both the balance transfer and my purchases. I called back to ensure that I would not be charged any interest if I paid off my purchases month to month, as I was explained. 

The associate on this call ( XX/XX/XXXX ) explained that this was not true. As long as I was using the credit card at all for purchases and EVEN IF I paid off the balance month to month, with the balance of the balance transfer on there, I would be charged the APR ( 29.99 % ) of the purchases each month. She explained the only way to rectify this would be to open a new credit card for purchases only. 

I explained that I had been told differently on a previous call and would like to file a complaint. I again asked how to rectify this. I was told there was nothing else I could do aside from opening an entirely new account. I was told my complaint would be "" noted.

It is with a heavy heart that I would like to formally put in a complaint against Citibank. Citibank essentially stole my money and refuses to give it back. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, an unauthorized charge appeared on my transaction activity. It stated this : - {$1000.00} Debit Card Purchase XX/XX/XXXX XXXX # XXXX CITIBANK , N.A . XXXX XXXX  SD XXXX Immediately I knew this was a mistake. I never use my debit card to purchase anything, so I called Citibank to dispute. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I put in a claim to dispute this transaction. They said that the investigation can take up to 90 days, but they will provide me with a {$1000.00} provisional credit during the process. Citibank then sends me a letter stating that if the investigation does not rule in my favor, then they will give me a 5 day grace period before they remove the money. If it rules in my favor, then I would just keep the {$1000.00}. Please see the attachment DOC1.ProvisionalCredit.pdf. 

As mentioned, on Friday XX/XX/XXXX I put in a claim. The fraud investigative unit is closed during the weekend, so I expected the investigation to start the next business day. On Monday XXXX, XXXX XXXX, 3 days later, the claim was already closed. They debited the {$1000.00} out of my account, did not provide any letters on why it was closed and the reasoning behind it. When they debited my account, it made my account negative - {$990.00}. 

Since XX/XX/XXXX, Ive been calling Citibank and asked them to provide me letters. I wanted a detailed explanation on why the investigation was closed and why it was closed not in my favor. When I asked them, they did not have an answer for me. In the notes of Citibank, it just appears as Other Debit with no notes. 

This has been escalated to the highest it an go at Citibank, and they still refused to give me the money back. They stated that the transaction in question was used to pay a Citibank Credit Card ( which I do not own one ) or it was used to pay a Citibank Loan ( which I do not have ). 

They said that they were going to email the merchant directly and will wait for a response. I wanted all the detailed merchant information so that I can contact them myself and dispute the transaction. They refused to give me that information as well. 

While I was disputing this, I also received a THREATENING letter from Citibank stating they will report me to Consumer Reporting Agencies if I didnt put money back in there within 15 days. I was scared that this was going to affect my chances of getting business financing in the future. I felt bullied to pay this. Please review the highlighted portion of the second page on attachment DOC2.ThreateningLetter.pdf. 

After I put the money back into the account, and after I sent in 2 appeals, Im still getting no where with them and I feel like I just gave them {$1000.00} that I can not afford to lose. 

Citibank has broken their promises with me. They closed the claim without an investigation and went back on their word on the provisional credit. Then they bullied me into putting more money into the account. Furthermore, they made a number of promises that they will send me a letter within 10 days regarding this. The 10 day mark came and went many times as I called and requested it many times. 

I really need your help. I do not know what steps to take next. They are not getting back with me and it has been over 2 months since the claim was closed. 

Please help me. I will provide my Citibank information below.

2. I returned some products in the order, the value {$440.00}, to the Bestbuy Store in XXXX, WI right after I received them. 
3. On XX/XX/XXXX, I got the credit card bill statement but I found {$440.00} is still on the bill. I paid off the bill which I kept the rest of the order, and I contacted CITIBANK and Bestbuy to communicate with the wrong bill. 
4. Citibank said it knew nothing about it. Bestbuy admited it had received the returning products but the refund was supending. I spent almost three hours in communicating with Citibank and Bestbuy. They didn't give me any solution. I was disconnected on the phone eventually. 
5. By the above experience, I realized it is really hard for me to get connection to them. So I have to wait for the next bill and I guess they will sovle the problem soon. 
6. In XXXX, I got a call from Citibank and I was told I had a bill past due. I realized it is still the problem from the refund because I have never used the Bestbuy Citibank Credit Card since the beginning of XXXX. I talked to the service and told her what had happened. She said she could see my complaint for them in XXXX. Then, the phone was interrupted again. 
7. In XXXX, I found in my credit report there is a "" delinquent '' of {$61.00}. I knew it came from the event above. Then I called Citibank Credit Card service and also talked to Bestbuy customer service. I was told by Bestbuy : 1 ) Service center had contacted the store in XXXX and it was verified the products were returned in XXXX of XXXX ; 2 ) However, the store didn't refund money back to the on-line shopping department. To be honest, I was confused with what I was told. Then, the service representative told me she can suspend that transaction and I have to wait. By now, no one solves this problem. At the end of XXXX, I have to pay {$150.00} of the minimum for the credit card bill in order to get rid of my bad record. I want them to return money back and give me some compensation.

06/02/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Bounced checks or returned payments,"Title : Citibank blames the victims of crimes and allows for criminals to get away with the scams they orchestrate. 

Today 's Date : XX/XX/XXXX To Whom it May Concern, I was scammed in XXXX of XXXX in the amount of {$2200.00}. The way Citibank has handled this scam has been nothing short of stressful, deplorable, and down-right baffling. The lack of communication between departments and the lack of communication between myself and those departments have either been non-existent or when existent, extremely confusing. Their inability to connect me to the correct departments through physical mail and through the customer service line was an absolute nightmare. In this letter, I will be thoroughly explaining all instances in which Citibank has failed in customer service and has made a victim of a crime pay for the actions of the criminal even when there was an on-going police investigation. 

When I was scammed I was a XXXX XXXX XXXX. A new one simply trying to earn some money. I began in XX/XX/XXXX and in XX/XX/XXXX I was lucky enough to finally find a steady job as I had been unemployed for 3 months. The job only paid {$37000.00} a year ( before taxes ). To say the least, I am not made of money. A woman contacted me to buy products from me for her step-daughters wedding. ( I have the statement I gave to police along with the police report ). Long story short she said she messed up the check. She convinced me to deposit the check and then send the money to a separate account that was apparently the wedding planners because she had included the wedding planners payment in the same check as my payment for the products she was ordering. She did this to steal the money from my account. Citibank was not able to catch the fake check even after TWO separate deposits were made into my account over the course of 5 days after depositing the check at a Citibank ATM. When Citibank finally discovered that the check was fake, my account was frozen, but luckily I was smart enough to remove most of my savings ( which was only around {$1200.00} ), leaving around only {$250.00} in my savings account. As I mentioned earlier, I am not made of money, therefore there was no money to steal, and my account went into the negative over {$2000.00} after the check bounced ( I believe I may have had {$35.00} in my checking account at the time ). 

After seeing my account had frozen I went into a panic, called Citibank, and I was told that I couldnt do anything and that I was responsible and I owed Citibank the money now. Money I didnt steal. Money that was never mine since my account was now in the negative due to this criminals manipulative and heinous actions. I can only imagine how many people around the US have had the same issue happen, and are now in debt literally paying for the actions of a criminal. 

After having a full blown XXXX XXXX since I had no money already and now was thrown into {$2000.00} worth of debt, I got on the phone with Citibank again to file two separate claims. As I mentioned earlier, there were two deposits that went through and both were sent separately to the wedding planner. One payment via bankers check ( I have a picture of the check and the receipt and the account numbers I was asked to send it to ) and one payment via XXXX payment ( I have a picture of the receipt ). The bankers check case was for {$1800.00} and the XXXX payment case was for {$400.00}. The next day I filed the police report. The next few months were probably the most stressful, frustrating, and depressing months of my life dealing with Citibank and their lack of customer service and common sense. 

I may have called Citibank 12 times between the months of XX/XX/XXXX to the end of XX/XX/XXXX. Every time I called I was either transferred to the wrong department ( a rep said quote : they always do that. ), given the wrong information to support my claims, was told that the letter I sent was never received, and I had sent it to the completely wrong address ( a letter that contained account information, case # s for Citibank, and my police report number and my address ), and the most frustrating part of it all was that on one of my last calls with Citibank, I found out the large claim I made for {$1800.00} was actually closed months ago even though on my last 9 calls I was told it was still active. Even though I had asked in XXXX why I got a letter in the mail saying that the claim was denied under the category of forgery BECAUSE I PRESENTED ID AT THE BANK and they told me that they didnt know what letter I was talking about ( I HAVE THE LETTER ). THE CLAIM HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH FORGERY OR IF I WAS THE PERSON DEPOSITING AND REMOVING MONEY FROM MY ACCOUNT. MY CLAIM WAS IN THE WRONG CATEGORY. It is important to note that my large claim was denied only 3 days after I gave Citibank the police report number. The police categorized the case as XXXX XXXX. I am amazed at how quickly Citibank was able to complete their investigation when the police hadnt even started theirs. 
This is what these scammers do. They get the person to do all the work for them so that the victim is left crying on the floor having a XXXX XXXX being told she is now responsible for the negative balance, while they enjoy the money they just made. Criminals/Scammers have been profiting off of this loophole Citibank has never closed and instead of closing the loophole they attack the victims. 
It was in this call that I also found out I had been given the wrong number to call when trying to get updates on the {$1800.00} claim. The {$1800.00} and {$400.00} claims were actually in different departments which I was never told about, AND the numbers on the letters I was getting in the mail were not even the correct numbers! How is one supposed to be productive if they are never given the correct information? How is one supposed to resolve issues when departments that have nothing to do with each other are giving information they dont have, are not privy to, or are not up to date with because IT IS NOT THEIR DEPARTMENT? This call was also where I filed my first complaint with Citibank. 

Due diligence is another thing that is not taught at Citibank apparently. I had to explain my story to a new customer service rep, sometimes multiple times per call, every time I called because notes were not being taken properly. Additionally, I have few letters telling me to contact the CRIMINAL that SCAMMED me in order to figure out where my money is. Additionally, I never received the letter I needed to send back with a copy of my police report because the vaguely named back office has their ways and already got my police report. Truly laughable. 

Fast forward XX/XX/XXXX, I still hadnt received the information on how to get my remaining funds out of my savings account mind you, I get a statement in the mail saying my account is now at zero. In the middle of a global pandemic, CITIBANK REMOVED THE FUNDS FROM MY SAVINGS TO SETTLE DEBTS IN MY CHECKING ACCOUNT WHICH WAS NOT AUTHORIZED. This is where I filed a second complaint with Citibank. I was also informed that the investigation for my claims was still under investigation ( even though I was told after I appealed it that it got denied again and the investigation was closed ) and I was told that if the investigation went in my favor the money would be returned. Why is my money being moved during an active investigation in the first place? Why was I never given the provisional credit I was promised either in the beginning? What is going on?? 
Citibanks Faults : 1. Incorrect information given on the status of on active claims ( repeated offense ) 2. Departments giving out information that is not part of their department ( repeated offense ) 3. Inability to transfer a customer to the correct department ( repeated offense ) 4. Victim Blaming 5. Moving money without the customers permission 6. Giving incorrect addresses where to send delicate information that includes full name, case numbers, police report numbers, address, and telephone number of customer. ( and apparently never receiving it even though it still went to a Citibank corporate address, albeit the wrong address, but still a corporate address where Im sure it could have been located ) 7. Lack of due diligence. ( repeated offense ) 8. Incorrectly categorizing claims, making the process even longer. 
9. Disorganization ( repeated offense ) 10. Incorrect phone numbers given on letters from Citibank updating the customer on the status of their claims. ( repeated offense ) 11. The inability to properly inform a customer on what department to contact when trying to obtain information ( repeated offense ) 12. Telling the customer to contact the criminal that scammed said customer even though the customer told Citibank numerous times to stop doing that for obvious reasons. 
I was a customer of Citibanks for five years ; my credit score is a XXXX according to XXXX XXXX and a XXXX according to XXXX. I pay my bills on time and I have always been a model customer to all banks. Never in my life did I think a bank would blame a victim of a crime for being a victim of a crime. It is absolutely nauseating. And to have it all handled so poorly. Beyond upsetting. They moved the money from my SAVINGS to pay off a debt a CRIMINAL created and used me as a puppet to do. I am LUCKY that I decided to move to another bank because I fear that my stimulus check would have been taken as well. 
Citibanks entire Code of Conduct is 56 pages worth of LIES. I would quote from it, but that would be pointless seeing as I would have to copy and paste the entire PDF onto this word document. 

I am not paying off debt that is not mine. I am not giving my money to a company that blames the victim, frequently provides false information, and does not live up to their Code of Conduct. The purpose of their claims department is to help those that have been wronged and to provide ADEQUATE, PROPER, LEGITIMATE, and TRUSTWORTHY investigations. I highly doubt that is what their back office was doing. 

As a side note : if the transcripts of each call are obtained by Consumer Finance ( I do not have {$2000.00} to pay off a scammers payday let alone funds to pay for a lawyer and get a subpoena ) I would be more than happy to devote my time and read every single 1.5-2 hour long transcript and highlight every single instance where Citibank went wrong to further prove my argument. 
Please be advised that I have included multiple appeal numbers for both the {$1800.00} claim and the {$400.00} claim. The number on the name of the photo is simply indicating that it is another photo and it is different from the others that are named similarly. It is not naming the appeal numbers in chronological order based on when they were received.

06/10/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Credit card company won't increase or decrease your credit limit,"I have been a customer of Citibank of over 12 years. I have an excellent payment history, and aside from a few occasional instances where I have missed a monthly payment or paid late, I have been consistent in paying my balances off in full. 

My credit limit as of XX/XX/2020, when I made my last payment in the amount of {$9200.00}, was {$15000.00}. On XX/XX/2020, Citi unilaterally lowered my credit limit by {$15000.00} to {$300.00}. I did not receive any correspondence other than a letter placed in my online portal. Because I was not paying attention closely to this other than making payments, I did not catch that because of the change, my credit utilization went from 0.5 % to 35 %. As I continued to spend on my card without realizing the near 100 % drop on my credit limit, my credit utilization hit 100 %. When I missed my XXXX payment, my credit utilization went up to 109 %. 

I tried calling Citi to complain and have them address and received no help. First they told me it was due to a returned payment, but I have not had any returned payments and they could not furnish any proof. They only said it had happened in the past and they did not have access to it. They refused to reexamine my credit limit and refused to contact the credit agencies to clear up the issue that has now damaged my credit score. 

I was then told it was because of a LATE payment, but they refused to identify which payment was tied to the decrease. They would not give any explanation why they would decrease my limit by pretty much 100 %. 

I am done with Citi as a customer, but I need help making sure this will not permanently damage my credit score. I am concerned that since my Citicard is my oldest account, my credit score will be damaged because the average age of my accounts will go down. I also would like to apply for a different credit card, but because of my credit score,  I am locked out of some of the better cards available for at least the next 29 days. Citi has refused to help in any way, they passed me around from person to person with no help and finally just left me to write some obscure department if I want them to address this with credit agencies.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",DC,200XX,None,Consent provided,Web,06/10/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3691262

I told the merchant I am not sure I will be able to attend a future event, and I am not sure my employer would want me to attend, and furthermore I'm not even sure I will be employed! They still refused to give me a refund. I filed a dispute with my credit card company ( Citi ) explaining this and sharing my communications with the merchant. They reached out to the merchant who provided a receipt for another conference guest in the wrong amount. Citi then told me that the merchant has a no refund policy and they had resolved the dispute in their favor.

When I made the online payment of {$650.00}, the Home Depot/XXXX XXXX  web site displayed a text box advising me that my next scheduled payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX. In early XXXX I began receiving notices that my XX/XX/XXXX payment was past due. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Home DepotXXXX XXXX  and explained that I was following the information provided on THEIR online payment portal that my next payment was not due until XX/XX/XXXX. I also asked why they were demanding that I pay approximately three times my regular monthly payment in less than a one month period, and if so, why was I being charged over {$300.00} as a late fee when their credit agreement term clearly states a late fee of {$38.00}. The Home Depot/XXXX XXXX  representative had no explanation to my question and advised me they would submit my issue to the proper authority for review. I received a US Mail reply, dated XX/XX/XXXX, from Citibank that stated they had attempted to contact me to discuss the issue. The only contact I had received, prior to this letter, was to harass me about my XX/XX/XXXX payment being past due. I was never offered an explanation or answer to the issue I was having, other than that I was mistaken and that my account was past due.

05/14/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I have a BestBuy Credit Card which has Citi Bank as the issuer. I first started using it back in XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, I had a promotional balance of {$240.00} which can be paid off over 6 months period without any interests charged. Hence, I planned my payment of {$42.00} per month, starting from XX/XX/XXXX, to be applied to this promotional balance. Meanwhile, I also paid full payments of whatever regular purchases I made during that statement period which has XX/XX/XXXX r XX/XX/XXXX of each month as the closing date. My statement balance due date is the XXXX of each month. 

Now, 4 payments later, I saw a promotional balance of {$130.00} which didnt add up. So I contacted their customer service where I found out the big issue. I first was told that all the monthly payments I made would be first applied to any regular purchases. Then the rest of the payment amount would be allocated to my promotional balance. This sounded no problem. It made me wonder how come my calculation didnt add up. Then I had the agent help me to go over how the payments were allocated each month. There came the big secret. For example, XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I made a regular purchase of {$150.00} which was due on XX/XX/XXXX. My payment of {$190.00} was made on XX/XX/XXXX which allocated to both of my regular purchase amount as well as the 1/6 of the promotional balance. Next month, XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I didnt make regular purchases. Hence, only the 1/6 of the promotional balance was due on XX/XX/XXXX. So I made a payment of {$42.00} on XX/XX/XXXX to the XXXX statement, thinking it would be applied to my promotional balance. Not the case. The agent told me partial of that {$42.00} was made to two different purchases that I made on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX. The was done once again later. My payment on XX/XX/XXXX was partially allocated to a purchase I made on XX/XX/XXXX, which you know, not due till XX/XX/XXXX. 

At first, I just thought this was confusing. It totally messed up my plan. Then I realized, wait a minute, the purchases I made on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX were not even due till XX/XX/XXXX. When I paid the payment on XX/XX/XXXX, there wasnt even supposed to have an official statement indicated these charges yet since the closing date was XX/XX/XXXX. My XX/XX/XXXX payment was dedicated to my XXXX statement. Why, in the world, did they allocate my XXXX statement payment to my XXXX purchases that had the due date in XXXX? If I had the due date on XX/XX/XXXX, who gave them the right to allocate that payment? Same thing to my XXXX purchases that had the due date of XX/XX/XXXX. They just allocated my XXXX statement payment to my XXXX purchase. 

The biggest issue is, if the customers were not aware of this payment allocation system, their promotional balance would end up going beyond 6 months when interests could be added to the remaining balance. Then I did a little research found out, on the BestBuy website, customers did complain about the same situation where they planned for 6 months equal payments but didnt notice the discrepancy till the interests were added after 6 months. For his situation, he set up auto-payment. I will have to call this a rip-off. 

The agent agreed with my concern saying that she would send a note to the management. I went back to read all the fine prints on their statements, I couldnt find any sentences related to how they allocate payment and how the payments can be distributed for each billing cycle. Most Americans have more than 2 credit cards and make multiple purchases a month. Their newly invented allocation system not only confuses consumers, but also applies payments to charges that are not listed, or shouldnt be listed, on the statements yet. If there is a closing date, the charges should not be listed anywhere else but the statement right after the closing date. This is unacceptable in so many ways.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a balance transfer from my Citi credit card account to my XXXX credit card account in the amount of {$3600.00} ( image attached ). The amount was automatically added to my XXXX balance. I was told by XXXX that the amount would be deducted from my Citi account within 7-10 business days. 

After 10 business days, the amount had not been deducted from my Citi account. I contacted XXXX and was advised that I should wait 14 days. The amount still had not been deducted from my Citi account 14 business days after I originally requested the balance transfer. I contacted XXXX again and was told to wait 30 business days. On or about XX/XX/XXXX, ( 30 business days after the initial balance transfer request, factoring in winter holidays ), the balance was still not deducted from Citi, so I contacted XXXX. XXXX initiated an investigation ( I can provide the investigation number, if necessary. ). 

Upon completion of the investigation, XXXX informed me that they had mailed Citi a check for {$3600.00} and Citi had cashed the check on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX advised me to contact Citi. I contacted Citi bank and advised them of the situation. Citi informed me that they had not received any funds from XXXX for my account. 

I contacted XXXX and was informed that they would mail me a copy of the cashed check. They told me to expect the check within 14 business days. I did not receive the check and contacted XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( images attached ) to inquire about the whereabouts of the check. XXXX informed me that the check was not mailed because XXXX advised me on XX/XX/XXXX, that Citi could not identify the proper account number for the balance transfer. XXXX also, allegedly, told me on XXXX XXXX to contact Citi, so it could verify the correct account number and apply payment. I was never advised of this XXXX XXXX information before XX/XX/XXXX. In the mean time, the XXXX employee opened another investigation ( I can provide the investigation number, if necessary ) to request ( again ) that a copy of the check be mailed. 

A copy of the cashed check was mailed on XX/XX/XXXX and I received it within 14 business days ( image attached ). After receiving the check, I immediately went to contact Citi bank. By this time, the coronavirus was widespread. Citi was experiencing high-volume on their chat line, so I took advantage of the option to leave my email address. I never heard back from Citi. 

At this point, I can not get in contact with Citi bank to show them the copy of the check that they cashed, or to inquire about the inaccurate account number. The balance transfer amount has never been deducted from my Citi account. 

This is not the first time I have had issues with Citi bank I submitted a complaint earlier in XXXX because Citi refused to reimburse me for unauthorized charges on my account. I am submitting this complaint in order to have the {$3600.00} deducted from my Citi account.

I used Citi credit card to pay for the 30 minute cab ride. The taxi driver quickly rushed me out of the car, swiped my card through the window using his phone paying system, did NOT obtain my signature and just drove off. 20 days later when I checked my statement from Citi card I realized I was charged {$420.00} for that cab ride! I was overcharged {$410.00}!!! I immediately contacted Citi and they reversed the credit pending investigation. They ruled out in favor of the merchant citing I did not have enough proof. How could I provide proof for something that I never approved or was never given a receipt neither did I sign anything??? I was scammed abroad. 
Customer service of the merchant does not provide English support so they are of no help. When I called and emailed Citi cards 3 times explaining in detail and talking for hours on the phone with different representatives, they are not willing to investigate further or obtain proof from the merchant, they are putting this responsibility on me, the consumer, who was scammed and a victim of bad business. They refuse to reopen the claim citing I still would not have the evidence. And in the explanation letter they are pretty much threatening to report me to the consumer reporting agencies if I do not pay the required and full amount ( which I believe is illegal to do so by FTC ). 

It has been the worst experience with the bank pretty much telling me it is my responsibility to pay over {$400.00} in charges I never authorized. This must be illegal and not fair towards the consumer.

I was bounced around from person to person for a month until I got in touch with someone who could help me. They told me my card still had a balance of {$250.00}, when I asked why I was being charge the {$25.00} fee they said this was the minimum payment. In 8 years, I had paid over {$2500.00} in fees, 10x the balance on my account. I asked them to remove the balance since I had more than paid for it already, they said no. I asked if they could at least stop the fees and I would call back to pay the balance, since their payment department was closed, the representative said they would stop the fees. A week later I noticed my credit score drop by 50 points with the reason that my account with CitiCard had been closed. I was never told that they were going to stop the fee by closing my account. WITH SUCH A LARGE DROP I COULD NO LONGER BUY A HOUSE. After trying, for another month, to get in touch with someone that could help me. I spoke with another representative of the company that told me they would launch an investigation into why my account was closed, re-open my account and help me fix the credit score error, but it would take a month. I waited a month for them to get back to me and when they did no explanation was offered and they did not help me with any of the other issues.

I found out today, XX/XX/XXXX, after seeing my credit score drop another 30 points, that they had replace my {$25.00} fee with a {$30.00} late fee instead. The {$250.00} had increased to  {$340.00}.

01/22/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Closing your account,Can't close your account,"When you shop at Macy 's, they ask you to open a credit card with every purchase. When you get a Macy 's credit card, they send you a ton of marketing material - literally I or 2 pieces a week, sometimes more. We opened a Macy 's card to make a larger purchase, a ring. Soon enough, we saw that with each payment, our available credit was reduced in an equal manner. There is nothing in the terms of the card that it was only for the single purchase. In fact, the marketing of the card, Macy 's XXXX XXXX Account, insisted it could be used anywhere. 

So finally, disappointed, we paid off the balance and told them to close the account. Unfortunately, they reopened the account for some fee they forgot to add on a closing time. Months went by with us throwing out all the tons of Macy 's mail - whey even open it, right? We closed out account. Hundreds of dollars of fees and interest on fees was finally brought to our attention with a collections call. Furiously angry, we paid that bill and said close the account and do not reopen it! They agreed that we were even and owed them nothing more. Then another statement arrived with another fee. Now only {$20.00} we paid that too ; now suspecting Macy 's has a pretty good scheme going here - accounts that can never be closed. Guess how this ends? It doesn't - we just got another statement with a {$2.00} fee. Seriously?

05/02/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I opened up my account with Citi in XXXX, a few years later, roughly XXXX or XXXX closed it and stopped using their card and in fact destroyed the card itself. My balance was probably around {$5000.00} or so at the time. So I have been making payments for 16 years. I am using terms like 'probably ' or 'roughly ' because I do not have access to my account. In fact I found out many years later that since I closed my account they took away my 'login ' credentials! 
More importantly, I had opted to receive my statements electronically from the beginning. So the company knew, or certainly should have know that when they XXXX my 'logging into my account ' ability, I had no way of seeing details of my account nor any transactions, change in interest rate or anything at all. They would simply send me an email, since I had opted paperless and in the email always instructed to log in to see details! Over the years, I called and complained about it and they always said : "" since my account was closed, for security reasons I could not have it activated ''. 
I lived with this situation for many years and I had setup my bank account 's bill payment service to automatically pay every month. So far so good. 
It was early XXXX that, because of some financial hardship, I reduced my automatic payment amount from roughly {$80.00}, which I knew was way more than the required minimum to {$40.00}, which I thought would meet the required minimum. I did not have the exact amount since I could not look it up. 
It turned out to be about {$5.00} short of minimum. I had walked into their trap. 
They, without notifying me, set the {$40.00} aside and counted that month as no payment. Added a late fee of about {$45.00} to it and jacked up the interest rate on my account to maximum possible. And this snowballed even though I never missed a payment. In fact my monthly payment would go directly to their late fees and not to principle, and they kept adding more late fees and the max interest. I was living overseas at the time and despite the time difference and costly phone calls they would not answer my questions since I did not have my account number that I had stopped using and did not have the card for some 12 or 13 years. They never did provide me with my account number and I found out what it is when I requested my credit report from the triple reporting agencies. 
All this could have been avoided if they would have kept my online access or switched my statements back to paper when they closed my online access. But then they would not have gotten roughly {$500.00} 'ADDITIONAL ' of my hard earned money. At the time of all this my balance was around {$2100.00} or so. 
How could they disable one 's online access to his own account, knowing that it is the only way I can see my account detail since I have opted 'paperless ' billing many years ago. And how could that have been security risk for me to access my own live, balance running account.

One in the amount of {$2500.00}, one for {$2500.00}, and one for {$2500.00}. The grand sum of these charges amounts to {$7600.00}! 

All three of these charges were close in amount charged, similar type of merchant, and all three from a square reader!! Much less, they were all completed on XXXX day and on XXXX Friday, while I was at home with my family celebrating the holidays. I was not out shopping, nor was I using this card on the internet. The square reader transactions all read from some type of auto repair store or transmission repair type store. 

Upon the realization of these charges, I immediately notified my credit card bank, Citi, to report the fraudulent purchases. They have a tedious process of asking you repeatedly the same questions over and over ( like your birthday, or where you were, or if you own an XXXX, literally several times in the same conversation ). Most conversations end with "" we will need to put this in for review. '' After many long and painstaking conversations with their customer service representatives, they decided I was not eligible to receive any type of victim protection reimbursement because I had admitted that I still had the card in my possession ( true ) but the merchant ( AKA the square reader merchant who is actually the thief ) used my card 's XXXX chip. They then threatened that if I did not pay this {$7600.00} they would be reporting me to the credit bureau! 

This is when I sent a complaint to CFPB. This was initially working out well in my favor. Citi sent a response on XX/XX/XXXX to CFPB stating that because I was maintaining my transactions were unauthorized that they would apply PERMANENT credits in the total amount to my account! Citi had also explained to me over the phone that they saw a note in my account that was previously missed where a replacement card was mailed to my address two weeks prior to the fraudulent charges and activated without my knowledge. This must be how someone took a physical card to use a XXXX chip to use in a square reader! 

Well, I now realize this must have just been a way for Citi to get a CFPB complaint off their list. Two days after my complaint was "" closed '' in my favor, XXXX from Citibank 's XXXX XXXX department called me to "" inform me they are reopening the case and that if I did not call her back within 10 to 15 business days to answer more questions in regards to this matter that they will have to conclude the investigation based on the information they have available which may result in the transactions being reversed back onto your account. '' They are claiming that they believe I am the one to have called in on XXXX XXXX to request the replacement card. So at this time, it must go back "" for another review. '' What a cat and mouse game they are playing. It appears they make a final decision, that isn't really final. 

I will attach my phone log provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX to this complaint. This is the log from my phone number which they state called in to make the request for the questionable replacement card on XXXX XXXX. I only have three phone calls for that day. None are for Citibank. I do not know where Citibank gets their information from, if they make it up, or what, but I am really upset they keep pointing an untrue finger in my direction. 

I am in disbelief that a company would treat a long time customer this way. I have been a good and loyal customer with Citibank. I have never had an issue paying my bills or keeping up with my accounts. I currently have two credit card accounts with them that I will be closing immediately after this experience. I feel as though I have been treated with complete disrespect all because they do not want to eat the bill. They have lost the idea of what it means to have standards and values in how you treat your customers. I have been victimized and Citibank has not been there to help me resolve this issue. They have only added more stress with harassment and accusations. I am a senior citizen working past my prime on a limited income.

These issues include everything from being sent underwear, which had been worn, and re-ticketed and re-sold as new, in these times of a Covid-19 pandemic, when extreme measures of health and cleanliness should be taken. Macy 's is selling used underwear to its customer 's as new. I have sent multiple emails asking they remedy this issue, via the issuance of a credit, or by replacing it with a new, unused item being, but the requests have gone ignored, as indicated for months now. Their boiler plate response to my email requests for resolution is that due to Covid, they can not assist their customers. And yet, they continue to sell merchandise. This, without ensuring they have sufficient staff to handle credit card disputes. 

I have also requested price adjustments, on several occasions, as allowed per their own guidelines, that price adjustments will be made within ten ( 10 ) days of purchase. I have requested price adjustments on at least four ( 4 ) difference items, and all of my requests have been ignored, with, once again, the boiler plate response that Covid 19 has impeded their ability to resolve price adjustments. And yet, they keep selling merchandise ; sales do not seem to have been affected. Only price adjustments, credit card returns, adjustments and billing disputes. These issues can not be resolved. Yet, they keep selling merchandise. I have calculated that I am allowed at minimum {$50.00} to {$70.00} in price adjustment requests which have not occurred because Macy 's is impacted by Covid and can not resolve the price adjustments. And yet they continue to sell merchandise.

When I have referred the inquiry directly to Macy 's Credit Card Services ( because they bounce the customer between their Macy 's retail and Macy Credit Card, causing delays and confusion to their customers ), the Macy 's Credit Card Services, bounces me back to Macy 's retail and does not accept a dispute on the credit card, which to me, seems like theft, because they are pocketing the price adjustments versus, crediting the adjustment on our Macy 's Credit Card. 

Additionally, in XXXX, I returned some items which were purchased and then returned upon receipt. It took Macy 's twenty-eight ( 28 ) days, or almost ONE full month to issue a credit on the returned items. More recently, I returned more items. Macy 's credited my account for only {$10.00} for one of the items that I purchased for {$49.00} plus tax. They have proof of the item purchased, and they have proof of the price I paid. And yet they have robbed me of {$30.00} plus tax on this one item alone. I advised them of this. They sent a boiler plate response stating they can not assist me due to Covid. And yet, they continue selling merchandise. 

Once again, they are delaying the crediting of ALL the items I have returned, with proof that I have returned these items. They have acknowledged receipt of these items, yet they not credited the items received for almost two weeks. But they continue selling merchandise.

It seems that Macy 's has been affected by Covid, only when it comes to refunding purchases, crediting returned items, authorizing price adjustments or responding to any and all inquiries that pertain to them returning MONIES to their customers. But ironically, Covid did NOT affect their sale of merchandise, and the money keeps coming in. And Covid did NOT affect their profits. Convenient, isn't it? 

I want my returned items credited, I want my price adjustment requests honored, I want the used/dirty and re-ticketed underwear which was sent to me, and sold as NEW to be credited, and a clean, unused and healthy item sent to me. 

And I want Macy 's to stop disrespecting their customers and using Covid as the excuse to do so.

When I clicked on the message it told me that my XXXX payment had not been made and I was charged a late fee. 

Perplexed because I know that up until XXXX autopay was working and payment was being drafted from my bank to to pay my monthly bill. 

On Friday, XX/XX/2020 I jumped on chat and waited 1.5hrs to chat with a representative. 

To my surprise I was told by the representative from Citibank via chat that the payment was canceled by "" me '' via email. 

Knowing that I never requested to cancel my autopay I pressed the representative for further explanation. 

When I pressed him to produce the document or communication that "" I '' canceled my own autopay he told me that he couldn't send me documentation only that the system was showing I requested to stop my autopay. 

I want the late fee waived and I want answers how this happened.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MD,210XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/28/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3626655

I asked when I would get my $ XXXX back and they told me between 30-60 days, and that is unacceptable especially when you took the money a couple of days after opening the account and I expect the same expediency in returning my money. They told me the decision to close my account was final and would not be reversed even though I haven't done anything wrong.

04/21/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with rewards from credit card,"As of my statement dated XX/XX/2020 on my citibank double cash back card I had a balance of {$230.00}. This statement explicitly stated I had "" Your Cash Rewards : {$200.00} '' ; this balance is what I have accumulated over the years in their "" Double Cash Back '' program. This statement stated I had until XX/XX/2020 to make payment. I redeemed the entire "" Cash Rewards '' balance of {$200.00} on XX/XX/2020, in addition I sent a payment of {$30.00} on XX/XX/2020 for a grand total of {$230.00}. I then waited for my next statement to generate as my current statement I believed to be paid in full. On XX/XX/2020 I logged into my account online to see what the damage was for the month when a notification popped up telling me I was delinquent and I need to make payment immediately. As a result I scheduled another payment and performed some investigation as I thought I may have scheduled payment for the wrong date or for another account thinking it was this account. I then found out my payments were on time and exceeded the balance of my XXXX statement of {$230.00} as my cash back redemption combined with payment was {$230.00}. With this information I immediately called Citibank to remove a {$29.00} late charge because my balance was paid in full and before the due date. I then was told by the customer service representative "" The minimum payment due was {$35.00} and you paid {$30.00}. "". I then replied I redeemed my CASH REWARDS balance coupled with my payment of {$30.00} exceeded the total balance of {$230.00}. The representative then told me "" Redemption 's to your statement are treated as a credit and not cash. '' I then replied your signage advertise 's the card as "" DOUBLE CASH BACK '', the statement generated says "" CASH REWARDS '' therefore when I redeem the value I have earned it should be treated as CASH ; otherwise the card name needs to change as well as the statement wording. I was then told "" It was redeemed to your statement therefore it was treated as credit not cash and since you paid {$30.00} and the minimum due was {$35.00} you were late and the {$29.00} late fee was added to your account '' I told the representative you can either remove the unfair late fee of {$29.00} or close the account and the representative closed the account. 

My contention is the card is advertised as being "" CASH BACK '' and the statement lists the amount as "" CASH REWARDS '' therefore it should be treated as a CASH payment. It is my believe the {$29.00} late fee is unfair and recorded in error since my entire XXXX balance was paid in full with my CASH payment of {$30.00} coupled with my CASH REWARDS of {$200.00}.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NC,281XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/21/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3615296

They said keeping {$50000.00} for 60 days is eligible to get a cash reward of {$700.00}. 

After opening those accounts, I received the letter to tell that I have to submit my ID and a proof of my current address. On XX/XX/XXXX, I faxed my Driver 's license copy and one of my monthly payment which shows my address. 
After this, I received the application booklet in a mail. I applied it by faxing on XX/XX/XXXX.

I received the check book and the debit card some time later. I didn't activate the card right away but I did it on XX/XX/XXXX.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter dated XX/XX/2019, stating that I was denied the account due, in part, to information in XXXX and XXXX. I knew that there was no negative information on either credit reporting agency. However, I ordered my free copy of the reports to make sure there was nothing fraudulent on them. Once I received them, and called to ask why the account was really denied, the representative could not answer the question, but suggested I re-apply. I did re-apply with a banker over the phone and the account has been opened. 
I do not think it is fair to provide an inaccurate reason for the account denial. I still don't know why it was denied the first time, but can only assume there was concern of fraud because I kept stopping the application process. If that was the reason, then the letter should have stated that and the account could have been opened almost two months earlier. 

Also, I had a hard time getting through to someone on the phone number that was provided on the letter. Obviously, I received the letter in response to an application. But when I called the number, the automated system wanted me to provide an account number. It took me several tries to finally speak to someone.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",RI,None,None,Consent provided,Web,01/04/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3485176

What Happened : On XX/XX/2019 ( Attachment 1 ), we wrote to MsXXXX XXXX XXXX, Citibank CEO-NA, requesting to delete from Citibank records all the information we provided with applications we submitted for a savings and checking accounts. We were never informed of the decision made about our applications and, therefore, had opened a savings account in another bank. 


As the reply from XXXX XXXX of XX/XX/2019 ( Attachment 2 ) did not address our request to delete all our information from Citibank records, and on XX/XX/2019 ( Attachment 3 ) we requested again the removal of our information from their records. On XX/XX/2019 ( Attachment 4 ) we received a reply stating that the information we provided Quote was supplied voluntarily by you to open Citibank Online Savings account and can not be removed. Unquote. We agree that we provided voluntarily the information required to complete the applications to get a savings account. However, the full property of this information is ours and, therefore, it is our prerogative to decide how to dispose of it in line with the legal provisions governing the ownership of personal and private information. 


In view of the above, we are herewith submitting a complaint against Citibank for refusing to comply with our request to delete from their records all our information we provided in applications for savings/checking accounts. In line with the provisions of the CFPB concerning Consumer Protection, which include the right and prerogative of the consumers to protect their information and dispose of it as they see fit, we expect that CFPB will compel Citibank to comply fully with our request.

The prepayment was made via my CITI VISA COSTCO credit card and the travel agency processed the refund back to my VISA caerd on XX/XX/2020. That produced a credit balance on my card of over {$10000.00}. VISA applied part of the refund against my current but not yet due balance and reflected the remaining amount as a 'credit balance ' of {$9900.00}. I asked VISA on XX/XX/2020 to refund that credit balance to me via a transfer to my money market account. I was told it would take 3-5 business days to process the transfer after it was approved. Today is the fifth business day since I made the transfer request and CITIBANK 's customer service team tells me that the transfer request, a refund, has not been approved yet and there is no time line as to when that approval will occur. Only after that approval does occur, will the 3-5 business day timeline commence. Hence, CITIBANK could retain my funds for an indeterminate period before I can receive a refund of money which I had previously remitted to them when I paid the balances that I had previously charged with the travel agency.

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, CitiBank 's co-branded partner XXXX XXXX terminated my AAdvantage account XXXX, confiscated XXXX AAdvantage miles ( including the miles awarded per the above schedule ), and cancelled three existing flight itineraries ( see attachment 16 ). The reason given in a follow-up email on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX indicated that the sign-up bonuses were obtained fraudulently : "" The investigation determined your involvement in multiple violations of the General AAdvantage Program Conditions. These actions specifically involve abuse of the AAdvantage Program through gaming behavior, used to circumvent the Citibank/AAdvantage card enrollment bonus eligibility restrictions. These restrictions are outlined in the promotional bonus terms, and at the top of each application page.

I was then asked if the card was in possession to which I replied that I assumed it was as I usually place it in a compartment in my car. I was not nearby my card and therefore could not go an check if the card was indeed there. I asked the representative if the fraudulent transactions were done using the actual card and the representative replied that it was not necessarily the case. We went over the transactions ( listed below ), and when I stated I did not recognize them, the representative said that the chares will be redeposited onto my account. My card was disactivated and I requested a replacement card with a compete new number to be mailed out to me immediately. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted again by the Citi Fraud Dept. and I was stunned when she accused me of having the card in my possession. I stated to the representative that I could not find my card anywhere and went on to look for it again while she was still on the line. She insisted that these purchases were made using the actual card and I told her that the card either was stolen or I lot it after withdrawing the cash on XX/XX/XXXX. I went on to explain that I rarely make purchases using the debit card, let alone in such frequency as when the fraudulent activity took place. I added that I was at work, in XXXX XXXX, NY at the time of purchases in question. The rude representative was extremely impatient and said that the fraud department was going to make a determination within 10 days. 
I walked over to the branch in XXXX, where I last used my card and asked the manger how I could get a hold of the ATM machine footage to see if I might have let the card in the slot and someone had picked it up. The manager said he was not allowed to release such footage due to confidentiality issues and added that the Fraud department could make such request. I contacted the Fraud dept and was told that such requests aren't made and that they weren't authorized to do so and that it was up to the branch manager 's discretion to release such material. 
I was stunned to learn that Citi withdrew the money back out of my account to pay the vendors involved in the fraudulent activity following the determination that I had the card in my possession at the time of transactions and therefore I was to be held accountable for the charges. I contacted the Fraud department yet again, explaining that I did not have the card in my possession and that they should ask request footage of the chip swap from the vendors, but they brushed it off. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to the Fraud department, asking to speak to a supervisor but I was told I had to send an appeal letter I order t reopen the case as it has already been resolved, and not in my favor.

In your XX/XX/XXXX letter you claimed that the photo of my New York driver 's license matches your record of a Kansas driver 's licence that you have on file. Please provide me with a copy of that drivers license as I am certain that the loans were the product of fraud. 

Last time I ask for your document to prove that the loan belongs to me, you have sent over a foreign passport of a XXXX national ( the passport does not belong to me ). Also, please confirm for whether your records indicate that this loan belongs to a Kansas resident ( US citizen ) or a XXXX national. You also claimed that you have verified the Texas address is under my name and social security number, would you mind elaborate how you did that? I never lived in Texas. 

Second, the loan you send over, per your letter, has a first application signed on XX/XX/XXXX, which was approved. But the applicant 's name is XXXX XXXX, with phone number XXXX. That is not my name and not my phone number. The second application, dated XX/XX/XXXX, was under my name XXXX XXXX, with phone number XXXX, which is not my phone number either, according to you ( if I understand correctly ) was denied. Would you please clarify, why you are attempting to hold me responsible for loan applications under two, different names, one of which is not my name. 

To be clear, I believe that your files are either mixed up or I am a victim of identity theft. In addition to the Kansas drivers license requested above, kindly send me all promissory notes and loan applications.

In our dispute letter, we explained that the XXXX dirham was incorrect and could not have been more than XXXX and supplied a list of items purchased. This letter was transmitted via the Citi website. 
- XX/XX/XXXX, after periodically checking the Citi website for a response or progress on the dispute, we found an update from Citi explaining that the dispute had been resolved in the merchants favor due to us not responding to Citi 's request for information on the transaction.

- We made several calls to Citi 's billing dispute department for an explanation. We were told that an email had been sent to us on XX/XX/XXXX requesting information on the disputed transaction. I informed Citi that we did not receive any email and asked why they did not post the request to the website. Citi personnel had no answer. Citi personnel could not tell us if they had our original dispute documentation letter in hand or whether  the XX/XX/XXXX email was asking for additional information. Citi personnel told us there was nothing more they could do as they were required to follow Visa rules.

- Two calls made to Visa customer support suggested that Visa had only guidelines. Any rules were set by the bank and the bank was free to reopen the dispute. 
- We pulled down emails from old, unused email accounts and did find an email from Citi dated XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. However, it was in an encrypted PDF form and was only good for 72 hours. We could not read it. Citi personnel could not tell us more about the letter.

- Calls back to Citi personnel with the information from Visa were rejected. We were told they were just following Visa rules and could not reopen the dispute. When we asked who we could  contact at Citi with a letter, we were given an address that was that of Costco. 
- By now, we are into XX/XX/XXXX. It took some time, but Costco 's local store administration had a regional Citi card employee  contact us. He did have the XX/XX/XXXX letter in the file, but it did not matter. He said there was nothing he could do. He could not explain why Citi did not post the letter to the website.

04/07/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by the fraud or security department at Citi AAdvantage Card about a charge of {$230.00} that was being attempted against my credit card. An automated call asked me to verify the charge or indicate if it was fraudulent. I indicated it was fraudulent. Then I received more two text notifications that the same charge was being attempted against my credit card. Both times, I indicated that the charge was not being made by me, that it was fraudulent. I received an email warning me that the same charge was being attempted against my account. Again, I indicated that I did not authorize the charge. I received a third telephone call about the same charge. At that time, after replying again that I did not make or authorize the charge, I agreed with the Citi agent that the account should be closed and all charges to the account should be rejected. When I returned home, I cut up my existing Citi credit cards. 
Citi then sent me new credit cards with a new account number. Some time later, I received an electronic bill for my account which listed the fraudulent charge against my account, as if I had made the charge - even though the Citi security department had identified the charge as fraudulent and told me it would be stopped. I called the Citi customer service and reported the bogus charge on my account. Their agent apologized and assured me the charge would be removed. It was not removed. Weeks later, the charge was still on my account. I called again and also emailed Citi to tell them to remove the charge that they had already identified as clearly fraudulent. I was told that they would need to open an investigation into the charge. I never understood why that would be necessary. Their own security department had identified the charge as fraudulent. I had told Citi on the date of the attempted fraud that the charge was fraudulent and to close my account. They did so. Yet they continued to attempt to make me pay for the fraudulent charge. Today, I received a notice from the Citi security department telling me that they were closing the investigation, and they had ruled against my claim that the charge was not mine. This is after their own security department determined that the charge was fraudulent and closed my account to stop the fraud. I just got off the phone with yet another in a long line of Citi agents - after I screamed at him about how Citi was committing fraud in attempting to bill me for a charge that their own security people had determined ( multiple times ) was fraudulent. He asked me if I knew two people who apparently used my account number to make the charge. I told him I'd never heard of them before, and I did not authorize them to use my account. I told him I had made this clear to the Citi security department on the day of the attempted charge. This agent said he would make a note to reopen the investigation "" for me. '' Reopen the investigation!!! There should never have been an investigation. I told Citi to refuse the charge the day it occurred. They should be investigating themselves. Citicards needs to be disciplined for this harassment of their customer.

I was assaulted and had my wallet stolen. One of the thieves ran up charges on my Best Buy Citi Visa card. 

This is the worst credit card I've ever owned in my life, and I can not wait to dump it once this gets resolved. 

That month, I paid off more than my entire interest bearing balance less the fraudulent charges. 

I was assessed {$15.00} in interest that month, because the citi had not removed the fraudulent charges from my account. Because of that, I was carrying an interest bearing balance for the month. However, if you reduced the interest bearing amount by the fraudulent amount, then I actually paid more than what I owed for interest bearing purchases. 

Fast forward to today, I received a letter stating that they determined the charges were fraudulent and they refunded the fraudulent amount ; however, they never refunded the interest. 

The assault happened on XX/XX/XXXX. It is now XX/XX/XXXX, and after repeated calls and time wasted, the money is still not refunded.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CO,802XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/18/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3612198

I then noticed that I was charged for two new / different products on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX {$88.00} ) and XX/XX/XXXX for ( XXXX XXXX   XXXX  {$89.00} ). 
Ive been a cardholder with Citicards since XXXX. I contacted Citicards online site to dispute these charges on XX/XX/XXXX since I did not order them, never received these products and did not commit to any obligation to an auto ship program. 

I believe these were fraudulent charges against my credit card likely from the same vendor. However, the Citicards online site to dispute these charges did not allow me to properly describe my complaint as a fraudulent charge for products never received. I did not believe I should be responsible for canceling an order I never placed and never received. 

Since I never ordered these or ever received these they can not provide any proof of delivery or a signature for the order or receipt. They just use the same card information that I provided to the original vendor / order. 
Im very frustrated that companies can use someones credit cards information and fraudulently bill people for additional products never ordered or ever shipped and CitiCards lets them get away with it.

Citicards is declining my dispute claiming I didnt cancel the order before the vendors auto ship deadline. I now have {$170.00} on my credit card and have spent significant time and effort trying to resolve this. 
Therefore, I need to raise this to someone who can thoroughly investigate and resolve this matter with Citicards.

Additionally, I be taking this to both LOCAL and NATIONAL news channels as CITI BANK has further made unethical and malicious practices against a customer during COVID-19 PANDEMIC who has a perfect payment history with them. Moreover, I am looking into things that I can do with my on staff attorney about any ambiguous clause CITI BANK may think they have where they can ask me to bring forth a payment that is roughly 60x ( YES 60X ) my minimum payment. I have NEVER had a PAST DUE amount with CITI BANK in 10+ years. 

Details : CITI BANK is demanding I make a {$12000.00} MINIMUM PAYMENT which is absolutely not a legal business practice or within my terms for a personal revolving credit line where my current balance is roughly {$18000.00}. My MINIMUM PAYMENT of {$510.00} in XXXX and was not only made in-full ON TIME but I actually paid {$1300.00} which is 3x what was required. 

CITI BANK is making unethical business practices during a STATE OF EMERGENCY and forced a credit line closure thereby withdrawing liquidity from the consumer market. CITI BANK forced debt collections and pre-mature Credit Card debt collections to customers who have 10 years+ of perfect payment history in addition to withdrawing liquidity to the market is absolutely tortuous and almost criminal considering they are being BAILED OUT yet again for not running a clean balance sheet. 

This is all in response to my {$13000.00} payment I placed a hod on when CITI BANK decided to tell me they were going to arbitrarily reduce my credit line once the payment was made. Again, pulling liquidity from the consumer market. I decided to revise my payment and pay {$1000.00} and they closed my account and are now demanding I pay them {$13000.00} as a minimum payment a month later. NOT LEGAL at all. 

They appear to be trying to use the clause in the XX/XX/2020 letter related to "" past due '' amounts and new balances ( letter included in this complaint ) however, I was NEVER past due and in-fact overpaid and have always overpaid above minimum payments so their letter is arbitrary and a blatant threat to a customer.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",TX,None,None,Consent provided,Web,03/28/20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3584103

- based upon this provided information and the newly updated balance, I considered the check valid, I completed my end of the transaction ; providing the sender with {$700.00} in the form of gift certificates from merchant, the XXXX corporation. 

On XX/XX/XXXX : - {$200.00} more was deposited into the checking account with Citibank, from the deposited check. 

On XX/XX/XXXX : - {$400.00} more was deposited into the checking account with Citibank, from the deposited check. 

On XX/XX/XXXX : - A second check was sent from the original sender, with the same conditions as before. Seeing that there were no issues with the first check, I deposited the second check in the amount of {$2400.00}. The check appeared to be valid, due to the fact that the check number had changed from the ending of XXXX to XXXX. Thus differentiating the two checks. 
- After depositing the checks, {$0.00} was immediately deposited into my checking account.

- In the afternoon, I entered the XXXX, Virginia Citibank location - and spoke with banker who helped me contact XXXX XXXX, and it was determined that the check was indeed fraudulent. The Citibank Banker confirmed that the reason for my accounts suspension, was the initial fraudulent check. 
- The banker informed me that the best course of action, would be to contact the fraud department. 

On XX/XX/XXXX : - I was still confused about the pending check, and contacted the Citibank team. I called them as soon as I could, due to the fact that they were closed for business on Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) after my in-person meeting with the Citibank banker. 
- They informed me that my bank account would enter the negatives, and overdraft, should the second deposited check bounce. I told the representative, that based upon the information provided to me by the banker in-person, that this check would likely be fraudulent as well. She told me that no action could be taken until I contacted the fraud department when they next opened on Monday XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX EST. 
- I told the representative to please make a note in my account, that I called, and the details of the situation that I provided. So that when the fraud department is contacted on Monday, they are aware of the situation.

I began receiving emails and a text message on XX/XX/20 advising me that I was then delinquent regarding a payment and Citi Cards ( Citibank VISA ) was charging me a {$29.00} late fee and they were then demanding over 3x the normal bi-monthly payment of {$170.00} that they now claim was due on XX/XX/20. I requested that Citi Cards ( Citibank VISA ) review their recorded conversation I had with their CSR on XX/XX/20. During this international / national crisis with Covid-19, Citi Cards ( Citibank VISA ) is acting with a complete lack of compassion for the hardships being endured by the American people as well as engaging in deceptive trade practices. This conduct is illegal during normal times, but is reprehensible during a national emergency. My personal income has been cut in half during this national emergency and Citi Cards ( Citibank VISA ) is acting like mobster loan shark debt enforcers.

The 2nd CSR ( XXXX ) did the same as # XXXX, but offered me so-called payment arrangements that were no more favorable than my initial minimum payments.

Citi now claims the promotion had expired, even though there was a new promotion that started XX/XX/XXXX that was exactly the same, and refuses to honor the deal. I have been told 3 times that a manager will call me back but it never happens. 

It also took me another month to access my account, due to an error with their site, and then an error with their shipping of a new pin, during which time I was denied access to my funds. So to date they have withheld {$20000.00} of my money for 3 months with no apology or explanation.

At the beginning of the pandemic, I called Citi to see what programs they were offering to Americans in lieu of the pandemic. Around XXXX XXXX, Citi informed me there were no programs yet that had been put into place. They told me to call back daily since everything was continuously changing. Fair enough, so I did. I called back whenever my work and XXXX XXXX schedule allowed. Each phone call required at least me being on the phone for up to an hour. Finally, on my 3rd phone call near the end of XXXX, Citi told me they would allow delayed payments up to 30 days and would waive all late fees and penalties incurred. Citi proceeded to tell me that for better offers and more relief to call a 1-800 number which they provided. I called this number and had to wait over 2 hours only to be told that there was nothing Citi could do and they did not understand why their representatives were giving out this number. This was very discouraging. I took advantage, or thought I was, of Citis delayed 30-day payment offer. Once the 30 days was approaching, I decided to check my account via my phone app to find out that Citi had ONLY waived the late fee I would incur had my payment been considered late. They even showed a late charge being applied to my account and then Citi refunding the late charge, BUT my account continued to incur interest charges. This made absolutely no sense to me. How do you delay my payments but continue to charge interest? I had a stellar account history with Citi, so this struck me as odd and unhelpful whatsoever. Immediately, I called Citi inquiring about the delayed payment program they had offered. I asked how this program was even slightly beneficial if interest continued to accrue under their offer? Citi informed me that they had waived my late fees. Yes, late fees I would NEVER incur had I not taken advantage of their so-called offer. So, again, what benefit was there for me the consumer? NONE. Considering I have a low balance, Ive decided to pay the full balance in two payments, but what relief are these super rich companies providing the American public? And what government bailouts are they reaping? Yet they refuse to help their customers!

At this time, my frequent flyer account holds XXX, XXX Available award miles. At a valuation of 1 cent / mile ( which is what the Aadvantage program miles are valued at for tax purposes ), this translates to a corresponding value of {$270.00} for the award miles in my account. 

Upon calling in to the AAdvantage customer service phone number ( XXXX ), I learned that I was supposed to wait for an email message from XXXX XXXX Corporate Security, but was not informed why I could not access my award miles, or what the reason was for being denied access. It should be noted I had not ever engaged in activity expressly forbidden by the Aadvantage terms and conditions such as sale or barter of AAdvantage mileage. I have repeatedly called in to the AAdvantage customer service phone number but was never informed of what was going on. I was informed that XXXX XXXX Corporate Security was 'not customer facing ', which means that it is not possible to communicate with XXXX XXXX Corporate Security for an Aadvantage program member, despite what happened. 

I learned from online social media that many Aadvantage accounts that had award miles deposited from credit card signup bonuses were locked. In fact, the one thing that appears to be common between these accounts is that they all had mileage that was obtained through credit card signup bonuses. At least some of those accounts were terminated, meaning that all mileage earned over the lifetime of the account was forfeited. My Aadvantage account also contained mileage that was obtained through credit card signup bonuses. It should be noted that earning bonuses from Aadvantage program partners such as Citibank is not against the terms and conditions of the Aadvantage program. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX CorpSec team notifying me that my account has been permanently SHUT DOWN, meaning that I no longer have access to my XXXX points. On top of that, my flight tickets were cancelled for my trip to XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. This includes flights from XXXX -> XXXX -> XXXX -> XXXX -> XXXX, which is a total of XXXX XXXX points ; a cash value of {$4000.00}. 

I ask that full access to my Aadvantage frequent flyer account is restored, and my ability to redeem award miles for travel or any other purpose is restored without restrictions. I also ask that access will not again be restricted when no violation of the Aadvantage program terms and conditions took place. Alternatively, if my account can not be reinstated, then I would ask for a cash-value of the points that would have been in my account, which would be {$4200.00} ( XXXX points ).

Someone with the authority to look into their practices need to ask them why they need to collect interest when people are a couple months away from losing everything. It is a shame that Citi cant come up with a better solution. 
Please help with this matter in any way you can as I am sure there are thousands upon thousands of people being bullied and strong armed by Citi .Shame on them for not being better corporate citizens, obviously they are not concerned with anything but their interest earned on hard working people who desperately need assistance in theses unprecedented and difficult times.

05/21/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Didn't receive terms that were advertised,"A Citibank associate, XXXX XXXX, aggressively urged me to open a NEW business bank account at his citibank institution in XXXX XXXX, ca, in order to take advantage of a promotion whereby i would be credited a {$700.00} bonus, if i deposited {$25000.00} and left it in the new business account for 60 days.As a result, to specifically take advantage of the promo the citibank branch was offering, i opened a new business account for my business XXXX XXXX XXXX, and within the first 30 days, i funded the account with the required {$25000.00}, AND the balance remained over {$25000.00} for the required 60 days. I never received the promised {$700.00} bonus. The business banker, XXXX, agreed that i had done all the requirements of the promotion and did not understand why Citibank had not deposited the {$700.00} into my business account. and encouraged me to KEEP my new business account at Citibank, for an additional 6 mos, while he did a respectful job of filling 3 disputes with Citibank disputes dept, agreeing I met the qualifications of the bonus offered by the branch for the full bonus of {$700.00}. {$200.00} was deposited into the business account, with no explanation as to why the amount was reduced by {$500.00}. I called and wrote the manager for the Citibank branch, and never received a response from the manager, XXXX, except an email to say she ALSO did not know why Citibank had not honored the promotional bonus promise of {$700.00} for my business account, but that "" there was nothing she could do ''. 
I sent 20 emails, and spent 9 hours on the phone, attempting to get resolution to the promotional practice which occurred in the XXXX XXXX branch of Citibank -- -it appears to be a bait and switch practice, as the branch did not fulfill the promised bonus, even though clearly the new business client, XXXX XXXX XXXX , fulfilled the terms. 

I fulfilled Citibanks obligation regarding the offer ; I specifically was encouraged to open a new business account at the Citibank branch in order to take advantage of a cash offer of {$700.00}, and id like a resolution to this matter. 
The Citibank customer service reps I have spoken to have advised me to take up the problem with the branch manager. I have repeatedly requested a conference call or meeting with the Citibank branch manager, and she neither returns call or emails.

I have been a faithful non-business Citibank customer for decades, and I now own XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX.. Ms XXXX XXXX  is the branch manager of the Citibank branch , and XXXX XXXX was the rep who actively ASKED for my business in opening a new business account and per HIS urging, I funded it with XXXX within 30 days of opening, and kept the funds in the account for 60 days, in order to "" GET A {$700.00} bonus ''. I clearly completed the requirements of this promotional offer, and even the banker that offered the promotion has agreed, in writing, that i have completed all requirements of the promotion HE offered me, yet said "" i dont know why Citibank has not followed through with the {$700.00} bonus on your business account -- -but keep your business account open with Citibank XXXX until there is a resolution! "". 
i have in writing, from Mr XXXX the bonus offer, as i asked him to write on a post it not the exact offer and requirements, and i have kept this post in in my file, in mr XXXX XXXX handwriting. I also asked for a COPY of the paper Mr XXXX shared with me regarding the terms of the bonus -- -his "" promo sheet '', Mr XXXX would not allow me to copy his "" promotional offer sheet '', stating it was for bankers only. It appears the INSTITUTION of Citibank has encouraged their private bankers to offer incentives to customers, to encourage new business, but does NOT follow through, and does not actually provide the business customers the incentive promised ( in my case, the incentive was {$700.00} for depositing $ XXXX for 60 days, which was done, and remained in the account for 63 days ). 
It goes without saying the repercussions that were felt in the industry for shady banking practices of this sort-, IE : XXXX XXXX  lost millions for opening accounts without customers permissionand a practice of encouraging a customer to open a new account for a bonus -- -then not providing the promised bonus, is clearly a bait and switch tactic, that was employed by this Citibank branch in 2019, and although I have spent considerable time attempting to get a resolution, it appears the corporate Citibank office decision is to encourage the bait and switch promotion tactic, and not provide customers with bonuses, even when all terms of the promotion are fulfilled. 

I am asking Citibank reimburse me the {$500.00} bonus which is still due on my business account immediately. 

I also received an incorrect 1099 for XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted for 2019 ( forwarded to XXXX XXXX twice, with no resolution ). The 1099 is for {$300.00} interest income ; the account earned no interest and was credited with only {$200.00} in 2019. 

I look forward to resolution to both above listed matters this week, or i would like to escalate this to the next level, if you can please let me know how to hold Citibank responsible for their promotional bonus offers. I am a XXXX female  XXXX XXXX -- -fully taken advantage of by Citibank promotional practice, by a banker IN THEIR branch, when i went into the XXXX XXXX branch to pay my credit card. It has been more than 6 mos since the {$700.00} bonus was due, and i am still told to "" keep your Citibank business account with us, just in case they decide to deposit your promotion bonus ''. Hence, i still have an active business account for XXXX XXXX XXXX at Citibank.

04/18/20,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Difficulty submitting a dispute or getting information about a dispute over the phone,"In XXXX of XXXX, I reached out to Citibank and set up a payment plan/ agreement based on a financial hardship after undergoing XXXX XXXX XXXX and being unemployed so I could recover. The representative I spoke to closed the account and set up a payment plan for what I understood to be {$350.00} per month ( I now know it is actually {$340.00} per month ) due on the XXXX of every month. 
Since entering the agreement in XXXX of XXXX, I have made the following payments, which are also reflected in your system ( Bank payment history reflecting payments included herewith ). 
XX/XX/XXXX : {$350.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$350.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$350.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$150.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$200.00} XXXX days after the due date. 
XX/XX/XXXX : {$350.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$150.00} XX/XX/XXXX : {$200.00} -14 days after the scheduled due date. 
XX/XX/XXXX : $ XXXX 16 days after the scheduled due date. 

Based upon my payment history, not a single payment has been 30 days or more late, which is what has been reflected on my credit report and is clearly incorrect. The latest payment was 16 days late, but there were also several federal holidays wherein financial institutions were closed. 
I have attempted to reach out to CitiBank directly to try and work out this issue and have been given the run around every single time. Every agent has told me that the department I needed to speak with was unavailable at that time and that they could schedule a call back, which the call back would never actually happen. When I was finally able to speaks to someone in the correct department I went over this issue, laid out my payments which made it apparent that not a single payment has been 30 days or more late and that the reporting was incorrect. 
The initial person I spoke with could not explain to me why these payments were reported on my credit as 30 days or more late, because clearly based on my payments, they were not. I was told once again that the department I needed to speak with was unavailable and that all they could do is schedule a call back, which never happened, resulting in me having to call several more times, being transferred several times and being placed on hold for several minutes just to speak to someone on how to fix this issue. 
The next department I spoke with told me that these payments were reported as late because I entered into the payment agreement already behind on payments and that because of that if the {$350.00} is not paid on or before the XXXX of every month that they will report it every single time and to review my statements, that they will show me owing more than the {$340.00} each month because I was behind on payments. After being told this I told the agent I was certain I did not enter into this contractual agreement behind on payments and asked if I could please be sent the terms of this agreement so I could review them as I have never received a copy. I was told that a copy of the initial agreement could not be resent, despite the agreement never being sent in the first place. I was then told someone can read me the terms of the standard agreement over the phone, which I obviously explained how this is not helpful because I need to know exactly what was explained to me and what I actually agreed to. I then asked for information to be able to request a copy of this call so that I could review the call/ agreement and was told that this is not something that I can request ; so now I have a contractual agreement that NO ONE will provide me the actual terms agreed to in writing and NO ONE will provide me with the call so that I can review the terms that were verbally agreed to. -This specific issue I find extremely disingenuous. If someone enters into a contractual agreement, they have every right to be able to review the terms of the agreement at any time, something that I have asked to be able to do SEVERAL times and have been repeatedly denied the opportunity to do so, which should be noted more than once on my account ). 
Thereafter, I went back and reviewed my emails/ statements as the previous agent has advised me to do. While doing this, it came to my attention that the email I received on XX/XX/XXXX, the month immediately following me entering this agreement, it indicated that the total payment due was {$340.00}. NO WHERE does it state that I owed more than this amount or that I was somehow behind on payments when entering into this agreed payment arrangement. ( XX/XX/XXXX Email attached ). 
Based upon the review of my emails, I once again called back to speak to someone regarding this and was told the department I need is unavailable, but they can schedule a call back etc. which I again did not get a call back and had to call again, be transferred several times and placed on hold several times. Once I was finally able to speak to someone, I explained everything that has happened up to that point, the information I was provided and then explained that I did not enter this payment arrangement behind on payments as I was previously told by another agent and that my XX/XX/XXXX email states that my payment due was in fact {$340.00} and asked how to get this corrected and again asked to be sent the terms of the agreement so I could review them as I have NEVER received a copy. I was again told that a copy of the initial agreement could not be resent, despite the agreement never being sent in the first place. I was again told someone can read me the terms of the standard agreement over the phone, which I explained again that this is not helpful because I need to know exactly what was explained to me and what I actually agreed to. I again asked for information to be able to request a copy of this call so that I could review the call/ agreement and was told that this is not something that I can request. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent in a Citi Group Ethics Concern Web Form regarding the above and did not receive a response. I sent in another Citi Group Ethics Concern Web Form on XX/XX/XXXX with the same information as before as well as the fact that I had already submitted a form a week prior and had NEVER received a response in return. In both concerns, I also requested for someone to look into being able to come to a settlement regarding the amount owed on this debt. I indicated at this time that I could secure I believe {$8000.00} and asked if that would be something that was possible to be able to settle the debt completely and just be done with this entire mess and again NO RESPONSE. 
I received a secure message on XX/XX/XXXX from Citi, however upon opening the message, the contents were blank and did not have any attachments or information. 
After several more phone calls and persistence I was finally able to reach an agent with a tiny bit more information regarding the above and was told that there is nothing that they can do for me and that I will have to send in a dispute to the disputes departments and was provided as fax number, address and the information that needs to be included in the dispute. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a letter to the executive department with the above information as well as another request to be able to work out a payoff on this debt and to be done with their company. 

I sent and email to their department on XX/XX/XXXX to try and get a response to my letter sent on XX/XX/XXXX as well as sent another formal letter on XX/XX/XXXX following up. I sent two additional emails to try and get a response to my letter on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

I finally received a response letter from the Executive Unit on XX/XX/XXXX stating that the information reported is correct. They also stated in the letter that because I was on a paydown plan, they could not discuss any potential settlements with me unless I cancel the plan, with a warning that if I cancel the plan it can not be reinstated and that a settlement is not guaranteed. 

I responded to the letter sent on XX/XX/XXXX basically asking them to verify what they are basing the reports on my credit off of as I had submitted evidence that not a single payment was more than 30 days late and that the first invoice I received after entering the plan had an amount of {$340.00} owed, verifying that I was not already behind on payments when entering this plan. I also explained that I had previously tried to call their customer service line to 1. cancel the payment plan and 2. to try and work out a settlement and was told that I could not and that I had attempted again that evening and was provided with the same information. 

I called the customer service line several times in XXXX ( I can pull my phone records and give a total if needed ) and was told that I could not cancel my payment plan because my account was delinquent and that until I could make a large payment to make it current, they could not cancel the plan, despite me being current on all of my payments on the payment plan, they were referring to the total balance on the card, not the plan they had implemented. Based upon this, I made a {$1000.00} payment on XX/XX/XXXX to comply with this request and called back. I was told at that time they still could not cancel the plan and that I needed to contact the executive department. 

I attempted to cancel the plan a handful of times after XX/XX/XXXX and was told by 2 separate agents on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX that I could not cancel the payment plan or engage in any settlement negotiations because the account was now "" current '' and it has to be delinquent to be able to cancel the plan. I explained to both representatives that I was told previously it had to be current, so I complied with that and now they are telling me the opposite. Both representatives apologized, said I was given incorrect information and that they could not help me regarding this issue. So I called my bank to reverse the {$1000.00} payment I had made on XX/XX/XXXX to throw my acct. back into a delinquent status and to comply with this new requirement that my account had to be delinquent. 

Thereafter I called and was AGAIN told they can't cancel the plan.

I sent an email to the executive department on XX/XX/XXXX and two on the XXXX requesting a response to my response I had sent on XX/XX/XXXX and explained the issue I was having with cancelling the payment plan as instructed in their letter from XX/XX/XXXX. 

In all of my attempts to cancel the payment plan and to engage in a settlement on my account since receiving the executive letter on XX/XX/XXXX, I have referred to the exact wording from the letter and have repeatedly been told that they do not have record of a letter being sent on my account and that I am once again "" lying. '' I have offered to send in the letter for them to physically see/ read it and am told they do not have the capabilities. 

I also left a voicemail on XXXX XXXX 's direct line requesting a call back on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ( I apologize I am unable to make out her first name on her voicemail recording ). 

I received a response letter from their executive department in the evening on XX/XX/XXXX with basically a copy and paste of their last letter regarding the reporting 's on my credit. Thereafter, at the end of the letter, they stated that they had no record of my contacting Citibank at any point to try and cancel my payment plan or requesting a settlement on my balance, that I was basically lying and that this was the last letter they would respond to regarding this issue. 

I still responded that same evening, despite their statement refusing to assist me with this issue any further and provided the recent call logs as well as messenger logs from their application messenger, verifying that I had in fact contacted them SEVERAL times to cancel the payment plan and to request a settlement on my account. 

I called the client focus team again and explained the letters I had received from the executive response unit and explained that I needed to cancel the payment plan and request a settlement on my acct. I also explained how I was told my acct. had to be delinquent and that I had reversed my payment on XX/XX/XXXX with my bank to be able to comply with this requirement and that I could provide verification of this. I was again told they can't do anything. I explained the recent letter I received and the refusal to respond to me thereafter and explained that I am at a loss as I do not know who else to contact to try and resolve this issue. The representative explained that she could not help me, but that she would schedule for a manager to call me back within 1-2 business days.

I sent another follow up letter to the Executive Department again on XX/XX/XXXX explaining that I tried to call ( again XXXX to cancel the plan and negotiate a settlement and of course, no response. I also left a voicemail on a general executive voicemail for someone to please call me regarding this as well as 2 voicemail on XXXX XXXX 's direct line requesting a call back with no response. 

I have attempted to resolve this issue since XXXX, XXXX and have gotten no where. I need to negotiate a payoff on this debt in order to be able to buy a home as I am unable to pay the full amount, but am unable to secure a home loan unless the entire debt is at {$0.00} and am basically out of time to try and work this out as an offer has been accepted on a house. I am beyond frustrated and disappointed with the lack of willingness to assist me with this issue and am appalled by the rude and blatant disrespect in the letters I have received in response to me trying to get assistance to work out these issues.. -At this point I really just need the payoff issue resolved and will just leave the other issue, despite Citibanks clearly incorrect reporting 's.

04/22/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"On XX/XX/2020, Citi sent me a letter saying they would be closing my accounts on XX/XX/2020. They specifically stated, "" Your account will close on XX/XX/2020 and any Citibank ATM or debit cards for this account ( s ) will be canceled 5 days before. '' On XX/XX/2020 I attempted to withdraw the funds from my account and received an error. 
I attempted the same again on XX/XX/2020, and got the same error. 

I called Citi at XXXX seeking clarification and to resolve this issue. 
I spoke to XXXX and asked why I could not transfer funds between my Citi accounts. XXXX said the Business Support Unit put the block on the account. And that while there was nothing she could do, she would transfer me. 

She transferred me to XXXX at XXXX. XXXX said there was a soft block on the account placed by the branch and no funds transfers would be honored. XXXX said to call a branch because she did not have access to the block. and put me in touch with the closest open branch to me which was 278 miles and 4 hours away from me in XXXX, FL. 

I spoke with the branch manager there named XXXX. She put me on hold for an hour only to let me know there was nothing that could be done. But if I called XXXX they could help me. XXXX is the phone number of a California cable company. I tried speaking to a fourth Citi representative named XXXX, but was told the same thing, nothing could be done. 

This is a clear case of a bait and switch and Citi acting in bad faith. After explicitly saying, in writing, the account would remain open until XX/XX/XXXX, and asking me to withdraw funds before then, they blocked the ability to do so and are currently holding {$270000.00} of my funds XXXX. 

I repeatedly communicated with 4 different Citi representatives over the course of 3 hours on the phone trying to explain that they committed in writing to closing my account on XX/XX/XXXX and they asked me to withdraw my funds before then. 

I had initiated external payment requests because of their written representation. I repeatedly mentioned that if Citi held the funds, and denied the external payments requests I initiated, there would be significant financial damages sustained by me because of Citi 's clear example of bad faith by committing in writing to closing the account on XX/XX/XXXX, but then locking my funds on XX/XX/XXXX.

I have always paid on time and have had my account set up on Autopayments with my XXXX XXXX account for years. Both accounts were set up on Autopay. I have also had other card brands, such as Thank you Rewards, and I believe a Thank you Preferred card, all of which were set up on Autopay, where the payment is automatically withdrawn from my bank acount monthly. On XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, my auto pay was automatically cancelled on my City Double Cash MC, and Citi Diamond Preferred MC, respectively. This was done without my authorization and approval. To my knowledge, I did not authorize this change. Because of this, both of my Citi credit card accounts became past due, which prompted Citicards to do an account review and lower my credit card limits on both of my cards. I feel this is unethical and fraudulent business practices. 

In lieu of the Corona Virus COV-19, lenders and credit card companies are actually waiving payments and late fees, and are not making drastic changes to customer accounts, in lieu of the pandemic that have taken the lives of thousands of individuals. My understanding is that Federal law forbids this kinds of discriminatory action, or drastic measures being taken against good, loyal customers at this time of crisis. Again, I am not experiencing a financial problem paying my account at this time. Had Citicards not stopped my autopay set up without my consent, both of my accounts would have been automatically paid on time and current. I ask that my credit limits be not only restored, but my excellent payment histories. I also ask that Citicards explain who authorized the cancellation of my autopay and why did that stop it. To this date, they have no explanation for me. 
In addition, Citicards allowed for someone to fraudulent use my Citi Diamond Preferred card from XXXX of XXXX until XXXX of XXXX, to charge a premium XXXX package for around {$15.00} without my consent. In fact, when I contacted XXXX, the account had not name on it just numbers and a gmail account associated with it. How can Citicards allow someone with a ghost account to charge for movie services on my credit card for months? 

My credit score has been lowered because of this. I am very upset that I have always paid them on time and now this has affected my credit rating with the credit bureaus.

The card information was manually entered according to CitiBank. Upon notifying Citi Fraud Operations of this unauthorized transaction, Fraud stated it was a billing dispute and not a fraudulent transaction because I had previously done business with the merchant. This seemed extremely wrong, however they transferred me to billing disputes. Billing Disputes opened a dispute case and issued a temporary credit. 
on XX/XX/XXXX Citi reversed the temporary credit stating it needed to go to billing disputes and forwarded the case to security operations.

When I had not yet received the check by XX/XX/XXXX, I called back and was told that the check had been mailed on XX/XX/XXXX and to please wait until XX/XX/XXXX. 
After not receiving the check by XX/XX/XXXX, I called Citibank again and was told that an investigation had been submitted and that I would have a check within 5-7 business days.

After not receiving the check on XX/XX/XXXX, I called yet again, asked to have my call prioritized to a supervisor, and when I spoke with the supervisor and explained the situation I requested that the check be reissued and sent by overnight delivery. The supervisor I spoke with told me that he could request the check be sent by XXXX-XXXX but that the request might not be granted, and that it could take 7-10 business days to receive the check. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called Citibank again ( 6th time, and 5th time since my original call ) to check on the status of the check and request a tracking number.

I also immediately notified XXXX. 

I was asked to be patient by Citi and was told it could take two or three billing cycles to resolve the issue. I have not received any communications from Citi or XXXX to keep me informed as to the progress. All that I've been told from Citi was that the investigation is closed and resolved via email. It does appear that there are credits on the account of {$38000.00}. I have no idea why that amount does not coincide with the {$33000.00} in fraudulent charges. 

My issue now is that I still have a balance on the card in excess of {$14000.00} and the XX/XX/XXXX statement shows approximately {$18000.00} in new charges from XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX that have post dates of XXXX and XXXX. These are duplicate charges that now appear as a balance. I was told by a representative in the Citi fraud dept on XX/XX/XXXX that those are rebilled as there are duplicate credits on the account from Citi and XXXX that need to be rectified.

He told me that whatever Covid virus, He is not going to care about any virus, or he is not going to fix the wrong interest problem on my account. The wrong interest accounting for related balance occurred about at least 3 times. I told him that after I made payments, my interest should be charged less. He is not going to fix that ridiculous interest. I really made the payments towards balance. He yelled me the same way with people who did not make payments. The interest is super high and not correct which keeps posting on my account. My balance is only {$1600.00}, however they made me pay {$50.00} for the balance of {$2400.00}.

The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 Section 106 ( 2 ) states, WEEKEND OR HOLIDAY DUE DATES.If the payment due date for a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan is a day on which the creditor does not receive or accept payments by mail ( including weekends and holidays ), the creditor may not treat a payment received on the next business day as late for any purpose ( ftc.gov ). My payment was due on a Sunday, a date which the company can not receive mail, was paid by my bank electronically on the following business day, and therefore, should not be treated as late for any purpose. This is the second time this has happened to me. The first time was in XX/XX/XXXX ; my payment was due on Labor Day - Monday, XX/XX/XXXX and was paid on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. The automated system removed the fees when I called in to Citi Bank. Now I'm being told that was a courtesy credit and Citi will only issue one per year.

Citi allowed one charge for $ XXXX to process and blocked the following two attempted charges for even larger amounts for more as fraud.My account was closed and a new card was issued. The chargewhich posted I filed a billing dispute for, as I was only provided a working driveable vehicle for about a day before being instructed to return the vehicle to the XXXX XXXX XXXX location who would provide me with another identical or better vehicle which I would be able to safely operate with my disability. A disability which was originally accommodated as legally required when I initiated the rental. The XXXX XXXX location refused to provide me with a safe, functional vehicle despite their requirement to do so under the ADA. I provided Citi with my written correspondence with XXXX, the case # 's they created and written commitment to void the contract out, in addition to my original contract which XXXX modified without my knowledge or permission. A temporary conditional credit was issued by Citi. Additionally, I filed acomplaint against XXXX with the Justice Dept and the Texas Attorney General for their many violations.Shortly after my new card being issued on XX/XX/XXXX, there was a new charge from XXXX for a toll road in New Jersey. I live in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I called CIti to dispute this charge as I did not make or authorize it. I was told my security preferences where changed and my new card number would not be provided to merchants as a convenience. Whichwould prevent XXXX from charging me further as I did not provide them my new card number. On XX/XX/XXXX however, XXXX charged my previous account which was closed and Citi allowed their charge on my closed account to post to my new account, despite my security preferences having been changed which should have prevented this. This charge from XXXX was for $ XXXX. The charge was marked as fraud and Citi closed the new account and issue a new card number. A week after noticing and reporting these fraudulent unauthorized charges On XXXX I called Citi once more to inquire why I was still being held liable for these unknown and unauthorized charges. At that time the security operations department simply told me the case was closed on the unauthorized charges since I had previous business with the merchant. They could not provide an explanation as to why the charge on an expired card was allowed to post when my security preferenceswhere changed. Fraud operations did however notify me the unauthorized charges were made without the card being physically present. Meaning the card was manually entered and processed. Yet Citi still states this charge which I did not authorize or even have knowledge of as valid and not fraudulent because I did business with this merchant in the past. A merchant who previously triggered a fraud alert and Citi blocked charges for. When I requested the documents used during the course of the investigation the agent stated she would terminate the line if I could not produce the contract for the fraudulent $ XXXX charge. That's a ridiculousrequest as I had no knowledge of the charge nor did I authorize it. So how could I provide such a document. 
The definition of unauthorized or fraudulent transactions are one that the card holder does not know about and/or did not authorize. Yet, Citi claims this unauthorized transaction where my cancelled card was manually entered is valid.

The XXXX damage inspection sheet at that time indicated damage to the front top of the vehicle which probably led to water coming in the cab. During my trip gallons of rain water leaked into the cab within minutes, soaking myself and my personal belongings including my laptop. I had to pull over and stay in XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX in Virginia as it was not safe to continue driving in that condition. I returned the truck on XX/XX/XXXX at a XXXX in XXXX   XXXX  and they were closed because it was Sunday. I left the keys in the drop box. I made a phone call to XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX to explain the situation and they stated the truck I had rented had not been checked in yet, however I would have to go online and fill out a report customer service form. I filled out the report customer service from on XX/XX/XXXX. It states on XXXX 's website they will respond in two business days. They responded on XX/XX/XXXX for me to call the claims department. I contacted the claims department on XX/XX/XXXX, the same date I received the email and explained to them what happened. I have not received any further correspondence from XXXX regarding this matter. On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a dispute with CITI claiming goods/services not as expected, and received a conditional credit. On XX/XX/XXXX, the conditional credit was reversed due to a ruling in the merchants favor based on the fact XXXX claimed I had never contacted them. In order to reopen the case CITI requested the details and date of each contact made by the merchant as well as their attempt to resolve the matter. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent them documentation, phone records, and copies of emails in my defense to prove that I made a good faith attempt to resolve the issue with the merchant. CITI also wanted proof of what was expected vs what was received. Examples they asked for would be a sales slip, certificate of quality, newspaper advertisement, or an itemized bill. On XXXX XXXX, I sent CITI a newspaper article where they stated "" XXXX trucks are one of the cleanest and best maintained rental truck fleets on the road. '' It also stated "" Every vehicle undergoes a ten point quality inspection to ensure proper fluid levels, tire pressure, and other necessary elements for a reliable safe travel '' As previously noted the XXXX damage inspection indicated damage to the front top of the vehicle causing gallons of water to leak into the cab within minutes. This truck was rented out with XXXX 's knowledge it was not in safe and reliable condition. It is safe to assume that when one rents a truck it shouldn't leak so profusely that you would need to pull over and get a hotel. I have clearly complied with CITI 's request for proof. CITI then completely closed the case in favor of the merchant stating I was unable to prove what was expected vs what was received, when in fact I sent them an abundance of proof. It should have been clearly decided in my favor as I was given a XXXX truck that was unsafe to drive. 
CITI reposted the balance of XXXX without any explanation on XX/XX/XXXX, prior to hearing back from the merchant. The merchant has responded on XX/XX/XXXX and the case has been pending since.

02/25/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I bought two airline tickets amounting to {$1200.00} from the travel agency, XXXX, using my Citicard Mastercard. I bought the tickets ONLY because of XXXX explicitly advertised 24 hour cancellation policy ( documentation submitted to Citicard ), which advertised that I could easily cancel flights within 24 hours of booking by paying a nominal fee ( documentation submitted to Citicard ). When I called XXXX within 3 hours of purchasing the ticket ( documentation submitted to Citicard ), I was directed to the user agreement and told that canceling tickets within 24 hours would be {$200.00} per ticket ( documentation submitted to Citicard ). {$200.00} per ticket is not a nominal fee ; their user agreement fees ( $ XXXX/ticket ) flatly contradicts their advertised fees ( nominal fee ). Because the original purchase was made under false advertisement, I thereafter initiated a cancellation of the ticket ( documentation submitted to Citicard ). Given that XXXX engaged in false representation to get me to purchase the ticket in the first place, and given that I clearly cancelled the flight well before the departure date, I should in no way be responsible for the full cost of two unused tickets, {$1200.00}. 

P. 57 of the published Mastercard Chargeback Guide ( https :  XXXX  ), details the conditions under which a cardholder dispute chargeback may be processed. The Chargeback Conditions for Goods or Services Were Either Not as Described or Defective are : the cardholder contacted the issuer claiming all of the following. 

( 1 ) The cardholder engaged in the transaction. ( I meet this condition - documentation submitted ) ( 2 ) The cardholder contacted the merchant, or attempted to contact the merchant, to resolve the dispute. ( I meet this condition - documentation submitted ) ( 3 ) The merchant refused to adjust the adjust the price or issue a credit. ( I meet this condition - documentation submitted ) And one of the following.

( 1 ) The merchant did not honor the terms and conditions of the contract with the cardholder including, but not limited to, 100 % money back guarantee, written promises, or return policy. ( I meet this condition - documentation submitted, showing the merchant did not honor their advertised 24 hour cancellation policy, as it contradicts the user agreement that I was made to uphold ) Time Frame : Between 15 and 120
calendar dates form the cancellation date of the goods or services. ( I meet this condition - documentation submitted ) Despite the fact that I submitted documentation of how each Chargeback Condition was met, Citibank ruled in favor of the merchant initially simply because the merchant responded with proof that I had in fact made the purchase ( a fact that was never in dispute ) and reversed their temporary credit. When I reinitiated the investigation, Citibank responded with the statement that they could not rule in my favor unless I could provide proof that the merchant explicitly agreed to credit the charge back to me, which they never agreed to do. I have relaunched the investigation thereafter and I have no confidence that Citibank will fairly adjudicate this case and protect me as a consumer.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",PA,152XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/25/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3543628

The event took place on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Upon arriving at the venue and proceeding to my seats I found that they were obstructed by on overhead seating section overhang, and by a large support beam directly in front of the seats. I was not able to view the game. 

I contacted XXXX and they said that all sales are final and they do not give refunds. 

I opened a dispute with Citibank and they proceeded to close the investigation without obtaining any further evidence from the merchant. I mailed them evidence of my purchase and the seating obstructions which were not listed in the sale. I included an email receipt, the seating map provided by XXXX, and photographs of the obstructions from the seats. 

After submitting this evidence, Citibank responded that We are unable to proceed with this dispute because you accepted and used the service after learning that the accommodations were not what you originally agreed upon. While we can understand your desire to obtain a credit to your account, we can not mandate that the merchant issue a credit. Our investigation remains closed. 

I do not accept that the service/goos were delivered as agreed when I purchased then. It is not possible to know that my seats were obstructed and therefor not what I originally agreed upon until after I had entered the venue to take my seats. I do not accept that there is no recourse that Citibank can take on my behalf. 

Please help me resolve this issue by insisting that Citibank reopen the dispute and request a chargeback to XXXX for the goods/services that were not as agreed upon.

I spoke to their executive office team member named XXXX, and she only provided me with a few specific examples but stated there are more. XXXX stated I was given permanent credit with no additional documentation required due to the dollar value of the disputed amounts. Moreover, Citibank also paid the merchants on these disputes when the merchant stated he or she believed the charges were valid. Then, Citibank wrote off the amounts. They never followed up with me for additional supporting documentation to support at any time during the dispute process, including after merchants ' claims. 

I have repeatedly e-mailed billing disputes asking for all documentation including the merchant response on my disputes. I have received very little from Citibank to date. I have called the dispute 's department and asked them to provide me with a list, but they stated I have to put in a request on each individual dispute. Obviously, I don't have all day to spend on the phone, especially when it is clear that their billing dispute 's team doesn't even understand what is going on. 

Today, XXXX, I called in to speak to a billing dispute representative to get information on some of the disputes. I called around XXXX and the rep 's name was XXXX . She was insistent that the merchants were not paid on specific transactions and that Citibank would not pay out twice, stating permanent credits were issued in my favor. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor. I was left on hold. The phone call lasted nearly 25 minutes before I finally hung up and decided to put the requests in to the CFPB. 

Previously, I spoke with XXXX in billing disputes on XXXX. He was able to give me specifics, but I am still worried if I was given correct information by how much I had to press him. 

Obviously, due to the number of disputes, I am going to have to attach them. Because of the way the CFPB formats complaints, it will lump the complaint into one paragraph which will make it difficult for Citibank to comb through each dispute and to get me the right paperwork along with the right response.

However, 60 days later, I noticed that my total Thank You points balanced had dropped by more than 120,000 ( beyond the XXXX I transferred out ) without any notification whatsoever.

I'm not able to view my account accurate balances I have also as well noticed that last weekend I had an extraordinary. Horrible experience where my account was frozen over {$4.00} XXXX ride that they sent me an email alert that I did not confirm I guess in time. I was very frustrated because I got an email alert for it, but City allows me to use my car all day long towards the evening. I noticed My account was locked. I was able to use my card through most of Saturday with no problem. And once I start to notice that my mobile banking was acting funny I called in and they had locked my card from use. And when I went to speak with the fraud department, they were very rude barely spoke English with several Representatives when I ask to speak to a supervisor, they refused me several times. They were telling me the supervisors would tell me the same thing that they were going to tell me being very disrespectful variant agonizing. Furthermore I gave them all of my possible security answers and phrases and they kept telling me that it was invalid. What I later found out because I have to wait until I went to the bank is that I did indeed give him one of my correct answers. I would also like to add. That I did log into my online banking and reset my password. I updated my phone number and several times when I spoke to different supervisors. I was told that they couldn't verify my phone number on the phone with me that I would have to know what number was on file which is very conflicted because I had previously spoken to several agents who had verified mine. Each time I called in. Each person would have the same attitude as if they flagged my account. And we're just completely incompetent. What ticks me off was that once I got to the bank what I found out was that I have two different verifications. I have a verification for my account. And then I have a separate verification password for my mobile banking. None of the agents ever clarify what? Passphrase verify what account whether it was my main account or my mobile banking with has two different sets of questions. Regardless of the matter I still called in with the correct passphrase for my account. I verify this on Monday when I went into a branch. So the last two supervisors and ages I spoke with completely lied to me and I want to call reviewed when I told them the correct passphrase and they told me it was incorrect and that I would have to come into a Brandt unacceptable. I have no access to know how much money I had in my account even to present day. They still have technical issues with the app and online banking XXXX. A lot of times I have no idea what's in my account. Because I'm not able to view anything to access my account. So now the account is overdrawn. XXXX XXXX XXXX and continuous limited activity. I don't see how it's legal or fair for bank and sit here and charge me fees or anything else when they have purposely I feel limited to access to my account so that I have no idea what's in my account. And when I call in for help, I get people the argumentative that are sitting up here and acting fraudulent themselves when I'm getting them the correct password for my account and they're telling me it's not and I have to Go into a branch. And knowing that I'm giving them the correct verbal password and they're lying and telling me it's not I spent hours on the phone with these people that was last weekend even still I'm having ongoing issues.

During the course of this fraud, several bank accounts and credit card accounts were compromised. 

On XX/XX/2020, I received a fraud alert that someone was attempting to use an account number under my name with Citicards to make a foreign cash withdrawal in XXXX. I immediately ( within seconds of the fraud alert ) called Citicards and informed them of the fraud, and instructed them to reverse the charge. They assured me it would be reversed, and that a new card would be issued. 

On XX/XX/2020 I received the new card account and saw that a charge for {$500.00} was authorized and an associated {$25.00} fee was added to my account. A statement was issued and a demand for {$520.00} was made from Citicards to me. I once again contacted customer service, and was told within 3 business days this would be reversed : XXXX : Citi has gone ahead and taken care this for you!! 
XXXX : Be rest assured Citi is there for you and wont be satisfied until you are You : When will I see the {$500.00} charge removed and the {$25.00} transaction fee removed? 
XXXX : you can see once you receive the new card and there will be no transaction posted on the account!! you can surely save this chat as a proof and the account will be good to go. 

On XX/XX/2020, I checked the account and it was still showing a {$520.00} amount due. I contacted Citicards customer service and was told I needed to contact the fraud department. 

Both a fraud department representative from Citicards and a supervisor in the department told me that I would be required to pay the full amount and all associated fees. 

I believe this is potentially a violation of not only Citicards own terms and services, but of state and federal law. 

I asked them to issue a provisional credit immediately ( {$520.00} XXXX for the fraudulent charge, pending final review, and they said that it would not be possible and I needed to pay the full amount or have it go on my credit report as a late fee.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",TX,770XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/15/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3533039

That was surprising, since I've been keeping on top of my credit score through a XXXX service ( using XXXX  ), and my credit score is excellent ( nearly 800 ).

I returned NEXT business day ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) and explained to banker ( who opened my new account ) what happened with teller/ my deposit. 

He didnt investigate the matter. Instead he brushed off the seriousness of her negligence. 

I asked him why teller walked away out of sight with a large sum of CASH? Why she didnt count it in front of me? And stated that Ive never seen this happen at any bank branch before. And how can I confirm she made a proper deposit? 

Banker replied that THIS BRANCH placed bill counters out of sight and DOES NOT COUNT CASH IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS purposely. 

I recorded him admitting to this on my phone. 

I opened an investigation with CitiBank regarding my missing funds AND the negligence taking place at this branch. 

CITIBANK REFUSED to properly investigate this, never reached out for my evidence, closed the investigation citing deposit was correct because branch told them it was, and is REFUSING to honor my appeal!

03/10/20,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive notice of right to dispute,"Good morning. 

The reason for this letter is to seek some help with three financial institutions with which I have been a client for years and so far I believe that they have treated my case unfairly. 

In XXXX, I became a father of XXXX  but unfortunately they were born in XXXX XXXX California at only XXXX XXXX XXXX, because they were XXXX XXXX we went through a lot of difficulties, even XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was in XXXX XXXX for almost 6 months while my XXXX XXXX girls were recovering so I had to move to XXXX XXXX so I could be with them in the hospital every day and make sure everything would be okay with them. As you can imagine what it means to leave your home, to find a place to stay in XXXX XXXX, to eat, etc., unfortunately the job I had couldn't keep my position and I had to quit within a month of asking for permission to be with my girls. From that moment on, my financial difficulties began, between medical expenses, rent, food, and credit card payments which I was able to make by taking money from my savings. And that is where I want to explain in detail why I feel it is unfair what has happened to me with three financial institutions. 

The first dispute I want to talk about is with Citi Bank, I have 2 cards with them and I have never been late on any payments, on the contrary, I was even paying off the debt in full. When I explained to them the situation I was going through and gave them all the information of why I was late in payments the only option they gave me was that I had to pay {$560.00} a month not to close the account, which I told them seemed like a lot of money at that time because I was coming back from XXXX XXXX and I explained my whole situation even sent letters from the hospital, but they didn't help me in any way. I made the greatest effort possible and paid {$560.00} for about three months, but I could not continue to pay that amount of money, I called again and asked to lower my monthly payment but there was no payment arrangement for more than I asked, I called several times and they did not give me any kind of help and closed the account which I am still paying, now {$220.00} per month because after they closed it was that they told me I could pay {$220.00}. This whole situation does not seem fair to me at all. I did everything possible to pay, I called to negotiate lower payments and they never helped me avoid closing my account. 

The second company with which I have to explain my dispute is XXXX, I had with them an XXXX   card, which I used very rarely and paid in full, but with them something very peculiar happened, as in my previous case I called to explain the situation that was happening, I made payments until I could from my savings to avoid late payments etc. I always made the payments through the application and never noticed anything out of place. After a few months, in XX/XX/XXXX, I realized that the account had been closed without any notice, even when I called repeatedly to explain the situation. The only way I realized that the account was closed was by logging into the desktop version since the application does not give any kind of notification or anything like that. I have called many times and asked to speak with a manager. They opened a case for me and still nobody wants to be responsible for the account being closed without any kind of notification, they did not even send me letters or statements informing me of the situation, not even a phone call. Three weeks ago I was able to talk to a manager and finally he was the only person who understood my case, he listened to me and he could see that in his system they had never sent me notifications that my account was closed, it was not until a few weeks ago that I received about 6 letters from XXXX informing me that the account was closed, do you think this is fair or valid for a client? That a person after having called countless times trying to solve this problem nobody listens to you or gives you an answer or takes your case seriously? I don't know what else I could do to get this account reopened because as I mentioned I was never notified that it was closed, I still make the payments on a monthly basis. 

The third company is XXXX XXXX, maybe I had a card with this company for years which I never used alone to settle some accounts but unfortunately they closed it and as in the other cases I exposed my case and still did not have any help.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",FL,331XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/10/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3561659

CitiBank sent a letter received today indicating that they intend to issue a check for {$390.00}, which is {$33.00} less than what I am owed. The letter states that they are withholding this amount due to a disputed charge.

That item has not appeared on statements I have in my possession since I closed the account in XXXX. Upon further checking, it relates to fraudulent charges that I reported to CitiBank immediately upon discovering them last XXXX after CitiBank 's security system triggered an alert for a suspicious charge. They were made at a hotel in XXXX XXXX XXXX when I was in the United States. There were two, for {$140.00} and {$87.00}. I was half a world away, knew nothing of this place, and certainly had not authorized any charge. I made my report within minutes and the CitiBank rep indicated that another charge was being attempted by someone at the hotel in XXXX XXXX while we were on the phone, and I was in the US.

As a result I disputed the {$550.00} charge for the plan with the credit card company I paid for it with, the Best Buy Visa Card serviced by Citibank. I disputed it on the grounds that I never received the goods and services that I had paid for and had made a good faith attempt to resolve the matter with the merchant who was now no longer responding. I frequently called Citibank to get an update and see if more information was needed from me ( their call records will show this ). I could not speak with the disputes group investigating the matter and was later told it was not resolved in my favor because the merchant had shown I authorized the purchase. When I pointed out that was not the reason for initiating the dispute, but that I did not receive the goods and services as described that I paid for, City Bank refused to reopen the case or evaluate how they well exceeded the time frame for these issues to be investigated.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I proceed to book the 3 rooms with them. My confirmation numbers are XXXX and XXXX. The third room was booked by our friend under her card separately. Everything was officially confirmed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, 9 days later I started to contact the hotel requesting to cancel the rooms due to the breakout of the COVID - 19. My family members and children traveling with me were not comfortable in going to XXXX because of the virus. The hotel refused to cancel and refund the money. They had advised that XXXX was still open and will continue to be fully operating in XXXX. I have reached out to the hotel from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX asking them to cancel, which they refused to. They did offer to reschedule for a later date, however, as the virus became a global pandemic and is not safe to travel at this time. 

I have also contacted the cruise line on XX/XX/XXXX to cancel the cruise and airline tickets. As you can see it was a large group of us traveling. They were very understanding and agreed to cancel the trip. I have also attached the cancellations from the cruise line so that you can see the trip was cancel in full. 

Again I have reached out on XX/XX/XXXX asking them to cancel and refund and again they refused to. I have explained to them again that New York is still on lockdown and I am not sure when we will be reopening. I have explained that the cruise and airline tickets have all been canceled and I can not travel at all. I have told them a few members that were traveling with me have been tested positive for the virus and are slowly recuperating. 

I have had this trip planned since XXXX, believe me, if I could I would love to go but with the situation with the world right now it is not safe and I refuse to put my family and children 's health at risk.

03/26/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"Hi, I am XXXX XXXX from XXXX, Arizona. I want to direct your attention to this situation that I am dealing with my Citi Bank Best Buy credit card. I made a purchase for a laptop that was roughly {$700.00} in XXXX along with some previous balance. All these purchases were made with Best Buy 's promotional apr of 0 % interest for 12 to 18 months financing offers. I bought another product ( ~ {$350.00} ) with a similar offer later in XXXX. The company selected a minimum payment and I opted for autopay so that it will pay off my balance in the due time. The first purchase that I made for my laptop had a promotional offer until XX/XX/XXXX and in the monthly email that I received it only shows me a total balance of about {$1500.00}. They failed to notify me that my promotional period is ending and I have to pay whatever is left of the principal amount. In XXXX, they charged {$260.00} as interest and kept charging me about {$30.00} every month since then. I have been making their desired payment ( on autopay ) every month and I just realized my balance keeps increasing and it's more than {$2000.00} now. Essentially they are just taking the interest out of the account and keep stacking the principal. I was never informed by a rep that my promotional offer has ended and I need to pay a certain balance. After 6 months, I have been paying hundreds of dollars and it's mostly counting towards the interest and my due balance keeps increasing. They have not charged me for the other purchases yet as the promotions expire in XX/XX/XXXX. I have no idea where did all the payments I have made so far gone towards and why do I still owe them the total Principal in addition to the accrued interest. They are essentially making me pay {$700.00} ( principal ) +> {$400.00} ( interest ) +> {$800.00} ( other balance ) and I still don't know where did all the money go that I have paid them so far. I understand the numbers may add up for the company and they are charging me the interest accordingly but I was not notified of this at all. They just send you a total statement balance email and you're supposed to find the full statement and understand what is being paid off and what is not and I still can't understand what I have paid so far in the last two years of doing business with them. They certainly want to hide this information and make it even hard to understand for people. I have attached most of my statements from past two years and can provide more if needed. I even asked with a superior rep at Citi to resolve this but they are not willing to help me or negotiate with me to let me pay the principal. I just want to put this all behind me and pay what I really owe them honestly and get done with it. Please help me this is financial turmoil for somebody like me and I look towards for help.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",AZ,None,None,Consent provided,Web,03/27/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3582064

XXXX said a letter was sent on XXXX 2020, by mail, informing me that the account had been closed. XXXX confirmed that zero letters were sent to me prior to the letter she claims was sent out XX/XX/2020. XXXX also mentioned the there was no timeframe to call back If I wanted to submit to reinstate my account to be reopened. Of course that meant running my credit again, which I shared no interest for. My consumer rights within the Citi bank policy grant me 2 letters of revert which state 2 letters will be sent to the customer, asking them to revert, if they wish, the account will remain open, to take action revert PRIOR to card closure. I was never sent a letter to revert in the mail. My address was current and clearly I never received and alerts of letters within my online banking nor any emails about the reverting of my account prior to closure. 
XXXX stated, she could not comment on the policies, when I read my rights, which were written by Citi Bank, to her. 

Here what I have an issue with : Error 1 ) they gave me 5 days from the XXXX, to address the account was closed on the ( 1st notification on the XXXX by email ) Error 2 ) I never received the 2 notification Letters prior to closing ( rule # 7 in document attached ) Error 3 ) XXXX stated I have any time to call back to reinstate which is false according to Citi Bank rules of 30 days.

05/11/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"I had the Citi American Airlines AAdvantage Executive Mastercard. The charge for the annual fee, in the amount of  {$450.00}, posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the balance of the statement, which was the charge for the annual fee. On XX/XX/XXXX, American Airlines closed all XXXX XXXX locations. This is the distinguishing benefit of this credit card. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Citi to inquire about a credit to my account due to the XXXX XXXX closures. At that time, I was told by the representative that no credit was being offered. I was enticed to keep my card open, as there would be positive changes to be announced in the near future. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I read online that Citi would be offering a {$220.00} credit to card holders. However, there were two stipulations : 1. This applies to those who had an open account as of XX/XX/XXXX. 
2. The one-time {$220.00} credit will be issued when the account was renewed. 
This information was released on approximately XX/XX/XXXX. However, I did not receive an email from Citi, nor was there any form of communication by Citi to me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Citi to ask for the {$220.00} credit to be applied, as my annual fee was applied in XXXX, two months prior. However, I was told this could not be done and that the credit would be applied in XX/XX/XXXX! There was nothing that they could do until next year. I feel that this is unacceptable. I had paid the annual fee in XXXX, and one of the primary benefits of the card is not accessible. And they would not be able to issue a credit to my account for 10 months!? I then told the Citi representative that I wished to cancel my credit card. However, no portion of my annual fee would be returned. There would not be a pro-rated refund. I am incredulous at this. Canceling my account on XX/XX/XXXX, means that for 9+ months, I will not be using this card. For Citi to keep the entirety of my annual fee is not just.

05/03/20,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a billing statement form Citibank stating that there was a balance of {$5000.00}. According to them, this was the result of a balance transfer into a XXXX  XXXX XXXX account. I immediately went to a Citibank branch in my area and notified them that this account was not mine and somebody had opened it without my authorization, in other words, somebody had stolen my identity. The customer service representative at the Citibank branch looked into her system and told me that yes, somebody had opened a credit card line of credit under my name and address. At my insistence, they contacted the fraud/security department at Citibank to file a complaint. In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, Citibank stated that I had received benefits from a balance transfer to a valid account in my name at XXXX  XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I downloaded a copy of my credit report from XXXX Credit Bureau. I noticed there were some errors with my personal information as well as 3 fraudulent bank accounts opened under my name ( Citibank, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX ). On the same date, XX/XX/XXXX, I filed an Identity Theft Report with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), reference # : XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted all 3 credit bureaus alerting them of the fraudulent accounts that appeared under my name. I requested that a fraud alert be placed on my credit reports as well as a credit freeze. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the 3 banks where the fraudulent accounts had been opened. The representative from Citibank, stated once again that they would investigate my claim. The other 2 banks, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX stated the same. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Citibank ( dated XXXX XXXX ), that the account in question had been closed. They stated that in order to further investigate the fraudulent account, I would need to complete and sign a Statement of Fraudulent Application, which I did and returned to them on XX/XX/XXXX, via certified mail/return receipt. On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed an Identity Theft Report with the XXXX XXXX  XXXX Police Department, 70th Precinct in XXXX, N.Y. ( Police Report Number : XXXX ; case # : XXXX. The investigator assigned to this case, Detective XXXX, of the same Precinct. On that same date, XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted letters to the 3 credit bureaus as well as the banks where the accounts were opened fraudulently. I submitted supporting documentation ( the FTC Identity theft report as well as the complaint filed with the XXXX Police Department. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received letters from all 3 credit bureaus regarding my complaint for identity theft as well as the disputes I filed because of incorrect personal information on my credit reports as well as the fraudulent activities. The results were as follows : A ) XXXX Credit Bureau- a name that was not mine nor associated with me was deleted. They also deleted the incorrect apartment number which appeared in the report and added the correct one. XXXX also deleted the Citibank/Citicards as well as the XXXX XXXX XXXX fraudulent credit card accounts from my credit file. 
B ) XXXX Credit Bureau- They updated my personal information. They also deleted the Citibank/Citicards fraudulent account from my file as well as the XXXX account. They however, kept the XXXX  XXXX XXXX fraudulent account, claiming it was verified as accurate. 
C ) XXXX Credit Bureau- They also had the incorrect apartment number in the report. ( I wrote them a second letter and asked them to update their records with the correct information. They stated that the Citibank/Citicard fraudulent account was verified as belonging to me. They however, deleted the XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX fraudulent accounts from my credit file. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX . The letter states that after conducting their investigation, they found that : "" we were unable to find eveidence that the tradeline displays on the bureau '' ; therefore, they do not hold me responsible for this account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I spoke with a representative from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX She stated that they had received my letter along with supporting documentation on XX/XX/XXXX. She stated that the account had been closed, however, there was an open investigation into the account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I once again called the Fraud/Security Department at Citibank . I asked them why I continue to receive billing statements from them if this account had been closed because of fraudulent activity as per the letter from Citibank dated XX/XX/XXXX. They were dismissive and kept switching me from one customer service representative to the next. One of the customer service representative finally stated, they would investigate and would send me another copy of the Statement of Fraudulent Application. When I inquired as to why I had to submit another form if I had done so previously, she simply stated to complete it and send it back to them ( which I did ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX Since I continued to receive billing statements from Citibank , I submitted a second letter, via certified mail/return receipt to Citibank , with supporting documentation about the fraudulent account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I received a letter from Citibank ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ), stating that they had completed their investigation and found that I was responsible for the account in question based on the following : "" you received benefit from balance transfers to your XXXX XXXX XXXX account ''. They further state that they request the discontinuance of any further phone calls or written correspondence with them. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I received a letter from XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX The letter states that after conducting a review of my claim, they state : "" We wont hold you responsible for any transactions, interest charges or fees associated with this account. 

In summary, Citibank, has declined to accept that the account opened in their bank under my name was a product of fraud because according to them I received benefits from a transaction into a XXXX XXXX XXXX account. They have failed to understand that the XXXX XXXX XXXX account was also opened fraudulently as the bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX, acknowledges on their letter sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX. 
It is now XXXX and I see no resolution to this problem. Citibank does not want to hear any more of my claims and further, does not want me to call or write to them. 

I respectfully ask Citibank to close this account which now has a balance as of the XXXX Statement of {$7900.00}. I also request Citibank to cancel this account as it was opened fraudulently using my personal information.

I applied for costco citi credit card on XX/XX/2020 when my credit score was XXXX. The application has not been approved. On XX/XX/2020 I received an email explaining why my credit card application got denied. The letter in the email attachment says that My score is XXXX, delinquencies in my credit accounts, high credit card balances which is totally incorrect. They received that report from XXXX Credit Information Services. I called XXXX  and they say that my report is in good standing and no such information is true as per the letter. I called citi credit card services. They say that they do not have any control and they just depend on what they receive from the system. I also had a hard inquiry in my credit history because of this false reporting. 

What kind of a report is that then? 

I want to report this incident so that in future this kind of inaccurate reporting does not impact credit decisions for me or other customers. 

Thank you for providing opportunity to report such grievances to take necessary actions if needed. I can provide more evidences if required.

01/03/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Non-sufficient funds and associated fees,"I lost my wallet or maybe it was stolen after watching XXXX night football and having drinks at XXXX XXXX XXXX. Because I had so much to drink I didnt notice until I woke up the next morning. When I called to order a new card they told me about a transaction where someone spent all of my money. So I disputed it because that was not me. I made the claim less than 48 hours from the transaction time and still was denied. The claim department has yet to honor me my money back. This just ruined my entire birthday and the holidays for me and I really need my money back. 

As I said I lost my wallet the night before and it had everything from my Id to atm receipts to my pin in it. I made that account online and was giving a automated pin, so to remember it I ripped just the four numbers out of the letter and kept it with me. I had too many drinks at XXXX XXXX XXXX and woke up hungover and noticed my entire wallet was gone. When I called I automatically was told my account balance after I provided my social security number to verify my identity. The automated message told me I had 3 dollars and some change which is not what I left in my account after making my last withdrawal. 

As said before I made a withdrawal on XXXX XXXX in the XXXX for XXXX $ the last thing I did with that card. I pulled {$80.00} and {$100.00} the 2 days before the XXXX $ withdrawal so I had some cash left plus the XXXX dollars when I went to watch XXXX night football at XXXX XXXX XXXX downtown XXXX. I dont remember the card numbers thats why its not provided in the beginning of this letter. When I found out about these transactions I disputed them furiously, I refuse to deposit any more money in that account until I receive my money back. I dont know if I misplaced the wallet at XXXX XXXX XXXX or the XXXX I just know I didnt have it when I woke up. I had to take off of work that day and everything because I woke up so late and hungover. When I asked where the transactions happened they told me something about XXXX and a post office at hours that I wasnt even awoke for. 

That was not me, citi is saying it is because it they used my pin. That does not make the transactions valid because I the owner of the card disputed them once I found out about them. I literally just put that money in there why would I spend it all at once like that when I have bills to pay. I told you guys the pin was in my wallet just the four numbers, because it wasnt a pin I created. I didnt have an online account yet to even change the pin and I didnt know how so I just dealt with it. 

I live in the XXXX, NY and I only used my card in the XXXX. Ive gone to XXXX XXXX plenty of times to do transactions that is the closest one to my home address. I have no ties to XXXX and its no way I couldve made those transactions if I was sleeping. I was not in XXXX the morning of XX/XX/XXXX idk if you guys want to ping my phone or what but I was at XXXX XXXX XXXX in apartment XXXX when those transactions were being made. That was not me XXXX XXXX, I am new to having a bank card I usually keep my cash but since I finally made a bank account I deposited with you guys. This is not how a new customer should be treated just because his account was recently opened i dont know what type of policy is that. 

I need my money back, how can you just let someone steal your customers money and tell him your not do anything about it. This is a bit ridiculous its been 2 denials and nothing is changing. I need my money back my entire birthday passed without my {$2000.00} and now its going on XXXX and you guys still havent refunded what was wrongfully stolen from me. I have bills and younger family members that receive gifts, yes I still get paychecks but that doesnt mean I dont need my XXXX XXXX. That was not me. Ive been going through this back and forth thing with you guys since I made this claim, Im not just going to let someone steal my money this is wrong.

A few years ago I received a phone call about the card and they asked if I wanted to be set up for autopay and I did. XX/XX/XXXX I went on my Home Depot account online to pay the balance in full before the autopay was to come out on XX/XX/XXXX. The online balance on my account was {$730.00}, so I entered by new bank account information and paid it off. The phone autopay was set up to pay on our old bank account. On XX/XX/XXXX the autopay of {$28.00} was paid. On XX/XX/XXXX the payment was reversed because they tried to deduct it from the old bank account. I received an email XXXX XXXX that my Home Depot Statement was ready to view. Thinking this was odd since I had paid it off in XXXX and had not used the card I went to my online account and there was a balance of {$140.00}. I looked back to XXXX and saw my payment of XXXX and the XXXX payment and reversal. Looking at XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX statements we had been charged late fees, interest and processing fees from the XXXX reversal. I called Citi to find out what was going on because I had paid the balance in full online. We were told that the online balance on XX/XX/XXXX was minus the autopay of XXXX that was set to pay on XX/XX/XXXX. We explained that seemed very deceitful and asked that all of the fees and interest be reversed and we would gladly pay the XXXX that we owe. The customer service rep apologized but said there was nothing they could do. We asked to speak to her supervisor, who offered to waive one of the late fees leaving us with a balance of XXXX. We then asked to speak to executive manager. He proceeded to tell us this was normal practice. We argued that we were set up on autopay on many cards, which we paid off online with no problems at all, even another Citi Card. The only resolution we asked for was for them to back out the fees, get it off our credit report and we would pay the XXXX and they would not accommodate. They said they would escalate to their corporate office, but there was nothing they could do. They also have our current bank account information on their website since XXXX. Apparently their autopay set up by phone is completely different than autopay set up online.

I called them last week to express my concern about the lump sum interest that is additional to my balance that I disagree. I do not mind paying the interests based on the principal that I purchased. They basically said that it was part of the contract per interest free for a term ( I think it is up to 18 or 24 months ). 
I hope I can attach those documents as summary : Page 1 - Show the lump sum of interest Page 2 - Show that I did pay some interest Page 3 to 5 - show that there was no interests.

I have called twice ( my calls must be recorded and can be verified ) to the number they provided and mentioned my case number however every time I called there was no answer so I precede with leaving a message with my current contact information but I never heard back from Citibank again via my email which is the best channel of communication since I have been living abroad for over 5 years. 
Unfortunately citibank will not allow me to change my personal information to overseas address and contact info ( only U.S local address ) in my opinion this was the root of the problem the fact that I wasn't reachable due to my current status which is living out of the country. 


After my account was closed I have tried to reach Citibank endless times and kept on being bounced from department to another without making any progress. I have talked to the Washington D.C branch manager where I oped my account, to citibank costumer support, to International wire transfer specialist all of which offered to call other departments and did not know how to help me. 

All I asked for was to be able to clear my name, to be given an address, a phone number where I can provide detailed explanation with supporting documents to proof that Citibank decision was wrong. Unfortunately no progress has been made until today. 



I am able to provide any documentations citibank needs to review my case and to freeze/ cancle any existing or future bad report against me.

In XXXX, completing my grocery shopping and errands became too difficult for me, so I began purchasing groceries and household staples online with my Citibank credit card using the website XXXX. 

I have one credit card and one checking account. I've had my credit card since XXXX, though Citibank was not always the issuer. Its easier to pay by phone, so I provided Citibank with my bank account information to facilitate telephone payments and I called Citibank monthly to make my payment. I always pay my bills on time. 

As stated above, my problems with Citibank arose from the three transactions listed below : Payment 1, on XX/XX/XXXX : I called and paid {$2800.00} requesting that Citibank use my account on file, ( # XXXX ). Citibanks agent entered the wrong account information and routed my payment to an incorrect account. Because Citibank misdirected my payment to the wrong account, the payment was returned unpaid as No account/Unable to Process. My bank statement for the subject period is attached as Exhibit A. On page 3, it shows that no Citibank payments were presented to the account on XX/XX/XXXX and a balance of {$14000.00} available to pay the bill on that date. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Citibank to find out why my payment hadn't posted. I learned of the problem and processed another payment by phone which was posted to the correct account and the bill was paid. 

Payment 2 : on XX/XX/XXXX : I called and paid {$4600.00} requesting that Citibank use my account on file. Citibanks agent entered the wrong account information and routed my payment to an incorrect account. Because Citibank misdirected my payment to the wrong account, the payment was returned unpaid as No account/Unable to Process. My bank statement for the subject period is attached as Exhibit B. On page 4, it shows that no Citibank payments were presented to the account on XX/XX/XXXX and a balance of {$10000.00} on that date. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Citibank to find out why my payment hadn't posted. I learned of the problem and processed another payment by phone which went to the correct account and the bill was paid. 

Payment 3 : on XX/XX/XXXX, I called and paid {$1500.00} requesting that Citibank use my account on file. Citibanks agent entered the wrong account information and routed my payment to an incorrect account. Because Citibank misdirected my payment to the wrong account, the payment was returned unpaid as No account/Unable to Process. My bank statement for the subject period is attached as Exhibit B. On page 4, it shows that no Citibank payments were presented to the account on XX/XX/XXXX and a balance of {$10000.00} on that date. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Citibank to find out why my payment hadn't posted. I learned of the problem and processed another payment by phone which went to the correct account and the bill was paid. 

As a result of the mis-directed/non-payments, Citibank closed my account. Ive contacted customer service and requested Citibank re-open my account on numerous occasions. Citibank refused to re-open my account in letters dated, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and in subsequent telephone conversations. 

I called customer service on multiple occasions and spoke to various personnel about the transactions in an effort to solve the problem. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to a supervisor named XXXX ( # XXXX ) who confirmed that the misdirected/non-payments resulted from the Citibank customer service agent entering incorrect account information for any payment. 

I even applied for a new Citibank AAdvantage credit card. By letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, Citibank denied my application.

I use it primarily for Costco purchases, and pay in full every month. 
I have always resided in Connecticut. 

on or about XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email notice from Citi that my account balance was {$11000.00}, and over my credit limit. 

My card has remained in my possession and has not been lost or stolen. 

Upon calling Citi, I was informed that a purchase using my card was made on or about XX/XX/XXXX, for services from a medical provider in California, XXXX XXXX, for {$11000.00}. The purchase apparently was made from XXXX, showing a XXXX change rate to US dollars. 

Despite inumerable red flags, Citi approved this charge on my account and reported it to the credit reporting agencies as overlimit, without reaching out to me in any way to verify this charge. 

The red flags included that this charge was completely atypical from my account usage over the several years I had this account, was for a very expensive one-time purchase, was an immediately over-limit purchase ( my other charges on the account at that billing cycle were for less than {$100.00} ), was made out of the country ( from XXXX ), to a medical provider across the country from my residence. 

This experience leads me to seriously question the safeguards Citi has in place to screen for fraudulent transactions.

I told her I would be mailing a check that day for that amount and asked 3 separate times that after this last payment there would be no other charges. I was assured that it would be only payment I would have to make and that the account was then closed. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, I received a bill for {$10.00}. I called, received no one. Moved and forgot about it until I got my updated credit score. A drop of 88 POINTS BECAUSE OF MACYS. I am beyond angry in regards to this matter. I was told everything was taken care of multiple times, that my card was COMPLETELY paid off, and here I was MONTHS LATER being told I owe {$10.00} with an 88 point drop in my credit score. I paid the now {$12.00} due to interest on this ridiculous card and my score only saw an increase in 16 points. Even while paying it, I wasn't informed on what the XXXX XXXX was or why I received it even when I asked. How can they get away with this? How many people have they done this to?

I have an XXXX XXXX AAdvantage credit card with Citi Bank. In XXXX of 2019 they reported my account was late on payments.

When I realized the payment was showing late on my credit report, I called in XXXX to see if they could remove the late payment. They said that there was nothing they can do once it's already reported. I called back yesterday and they also repeated the same thing, that once it is reported there is nothing they can do. 

I have 10 credit cards and NONE of my credit cards have EVER been paid late. All of my other credit cards were paid on time in XXXX of 2019 and this one mysteriously wasn't.

I paid off my account, over $ XXXX, in XXXX yet they continue to bill me for fees. I've contacted them now at least three times to resolve this, kindly asking for fees to be waived, however I received an email notification and collection call within the last few days requesting payment. The balance on this account is around {$23.00}, which are all fees. When the collection automatic dialer contacted me I selected the option to speak to someone, to which it hung up on me. Again not a good customer experience in the least bit. 

I am beyond frustrated, furious and livid that this has now taken so much time to resolve. It's difficult to believe that three Citi Card associates have yet to resolve this concern. The first one asked me to call some other department, to which their call volume was so high you can't even get through. Then I contacted them back again, and again, but yet I still have a balance of fees. 

In all I want this balance removed in full. Obviously, I can afford to pay {$23.00} but it's the principle at this point.

The tenant did so in order to avoid eviction after he fell months behind in rent. 
XX/XX/XXXX I filed suit against the individual who filed a Forged Deed and committed identity theft claiming ownership of my property at in XXXX Texas ( XXXX ) in the XXXX District Court of XXXX County. 
XX/XX/XXXX Multiple retained attorneys advise me and notify XXXX ( Mortgage Company ) of the pending lawsuit and forged deed. Additionally, I was advised to not make payments until the litigation was resolved as I stood a chance to lose not only the monies I had in the property but additionally any more monies I put in or paid off related to the property. 
XX/XX/XXXX Tenant moves to sell property with the FORGED DEED claiming title but XXXX XXXX who they were trying to use to close the property will not close as they find pending litigation on the property. Tenant then proceeds to find another Title company in XXXX Texas to do a remote closing a week or so later and the property is then sold by tenant to a new buyer through XXXX XXXX XXXX. Tenant falsely misrepresented to the title company that he is the owner and there is no litigation on the property ; the title company did not do their due diligence which resulted in the tenant proceeding to sign my name and use my SS # and other credentials thereby committing another case of forgery but this time an additional charge of identity theft. Proceeds of nearly $ 30,000+ were taken out and my outstanding mortgage loan on the property was paid in full by the buyer through the title company. Clean title was not given as litigation is still pending at XXXX County and set for trial in XX/XX/XXXX. The buyer was aware of this when they decided to take the risk and change to another title company after XXXX told them there was pending litigation and they would not close. 
o The judgement on this case should be in my favor due to the forgery committed that allowed all of this to happen. The property title will be corrected and the last clear chain of title when I purchased the property in XXXX will be recognized as true and correct. I will then move to evict the current occupant through the sheriffs office. That individual will then have to go to the title company and move to sue the tenant who has committed all of these crimes and I am not a party to that suit or any of the other suits involving the title company, mortgage company, etc. 
XX/XX/XXXX {$13000.00} payment made to CITI through CITI website to reduce utilization down to 30 % and improve credit score 40+ points in order to secure a HELOC to borrow against 350k+ Equity in my primary residence at and use that line to eliminate remaining revolving debts. 
XX/XX/XXXX CITI reduces my credit line by {$13000.00} on that account. I cancel additional payment of {$15000.00} on another CITI account and begin to seek answer from CITI on decreased credit line on the first account and what can be done to fix this issue. 
XX/XX/XXXX I speak with supervisor a CITI ( Kentucky location ) who advises me to cancel my payment through my bank to CITI as it has not posted as he tell me he is unable to cancel it on the CITI end. He then escalates the matter and sets up a call with Presidential Department ( CITI ) to discuss keeping my line of credit open and allowing me to explain why my credit score fell ( at no fault to me ) in hopes of keeping my credit line and repairing my credit given I have had 10+ years of flawless credit history with CITI . 
XX/XX/XXXX I call and speak with another representative who confirms I have a spot to be called by the Presidential Department. I ask if there are any locations I can do in and see a banker and there are none in Texas or surrounding states. We hang up with the understanding that I will receive a call to have the option to discuss my situation. 
XX/XX/XXXX Representative from CITI Presidential Department calls and leaves a voicemail. 
o I call back no answer, leave voicemail, proceed to call her 14 times and leave 2-3 voicemails over the next couple days with no call back. 
I call CITI and leave a message for them to have contact me. Citi Reference Number :  XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I receive a notification email that payment was returned unpaid. I knew this as this is what I was instructed to do by CITI employees on both XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX in order to discuss my options with the Presidential Department and potentially have the ability to my credit line. 
I log onto CITI website and see that something is wrong. I immediately see that both my CITI accounts have been closed. 
I contact CITI looking to speak with yet another American Supervisor as I still can not reach the Presidential Department. I speak with a gentleman with CITI in Arizona who informs me that because my account has been closed there is nothing he or I can do until I receive a letter in the mail explaining why my account was closed. He does tell me the credit line was reduced due to a credit pull but he thinks the line was closed due to the returned payment. 
o Mind you the returned payment was an additional payment as I had already paid another payment earlier in the Month. I have since made another payment for {$1000.00} and {$800.00} to each of my accounts with CITI. 
XX/XX/XXXX I call and finally get a chance to speak with Presidential Department ( had been trying to reach since Monday XXXX XXXX ) and she has to notify me that I no longer can make the request to keep my line and now have to make a request to reinstate my line. Asks me to resolve my credit dispute before doing so in hopes that she can restore my line after the dispute is corrected. 
o Problem : She doesnt realize the closing of my accounts maliciously and in bad taste by CITI will have more adverse effects on my credit. Likewise, the reason for doing so is due to someone fraudulently signing my name and forging documents in order to avoid eviction which had massive effects on my credit. 

In short : I have a whole lot more information if CFPB would like it. 
1. My attorney sent notice of pending lawsuit to XXXX ( Mortgagor who needs to fix false reporting ) 2. XXXX Responds with Modification to loan 1. Breakdown in Modification Docs ( I have these docs for CFPB, also sent to CITI ) 3. Modification Payment made in full ( overpaid ) 4. 2nd Modification Payment made in full ( overpaid ) 5.  My attorney requested for XXXX to become party to pending lawsuit related to title on and want for declaration of property be awarded to me. This would ensure their position of securing their security note by way of my deed. Remember, we are in litigation over forgery of a deed claiming I removed my interest in the property to the tenant. 
1. Another payment was not made as XXXX as they refused to join the suit and notify the court to have the property awarded to me which would secure their own note. They said they did not have an attorney and would let the court rule accordingly. Mind you, another payment was not due as I was overpaid on payments so I was not forgoing my payments just not making additional payment. 
2. Moreover, the mortgage company reported that I made no payments in XXXX through XXXX but the transaction but not only did I make payments but I made additional payment to fully cover all three of those payments. This is the issue we are having with XXXX on top of the litigation related to the suit on proper title.

The merchant is XXXX  located in XXXX, XXXX. The charge was done on my XXXX ( my wife ) Citi Business card ending in XXXX. Citi did give us a temporary dispute credit, but upon further review of the case ( Case ID : XXXX XXXX ) decided to reverse the temporary credit. This is incorrect because we did not receive benefit from this transaction. We received no service or merchandize from the merchant. 

Here are the details of what happened : My wife, XXXX XXXX, shopped in person at XXXX in XXXX, XXXX on or about XX/XX/2020. She purchased a childs dress for our granddaughter that cost {$29.00}. XXXX attempted to pay with her Citi Business card ending in XXXX but the merchant said that the charge would not go through. So XXXX had the merchant use XXXX XXXX XXXX card ending in XXXX and this charge successfully processed and is correct. Please see the attached document that shows this transaction with XXXX for {$29.00}. 
The childs dress for {$29.00} is the only item that XXXX purchased while shopping at XXXX. XXXX never returned to this merchant on another date and did not authorize any other charges. 
This merchant then processed a second unauthorized charge for {$200.00} dated XX/XX/2020. This one on the XXXX XXXX XXXX card and is the subject of another CFPB compliant ( Complaint ID : XXXX ) with XXXX. We did not receive any benefit for this transaction and then disputed the transaction with XXXX. 
We are unable to reach the merchant. The merchant is located in XXXX, XXXX and we live in XXXX IL USA so we have no way of contacting them. We have tried by email and have been unsuccessful obtaining a response. 

To summarize, XXXX did not authorize the {$130.00} disputed charge of the Citi Business Platinum Select Mastercard. We  did not receive any merchandise or service for this transaction. As explained earlier, the merchant swiped two credit cards on or about XX/XX/2020. First the Citi Business card ending in XXXX that the merchant said did not work, then XXXX XXXX XXXX ending in XXXX. A charge for {$29.00} was processed on the XXXX card that we do not dispute. The merchant somehow stored the card information to fraudulently charge unauthorized charges of {$200.00} on XX/XX/2020 on the XXXX card ending in XXXX, and also {$130.00} on XX/XX/2020 on the Citi Business Mastercard card ending in XXXX. The merchant is dishonest. 
We have purchased thousands of dollars worth of merchandize and services using the Citi Business Platinum Select Mastercard. We rarely dispute transactions and are disappointed that Citi decided to believe the merchant over us. 
We demand that the merchant be held accountable and that the {$130.00} charge be credited to our Citi Business card account promptly. We do not feel safe anymore using our credit cards in foreign countries since the Banks do not want to stand by and protect us from dishonest merchants.

I have tried now almost a year to have this money wrongfully held. Neither XXXX XXXX or Citibank will help in my cause. Neither have offered us relief let alone help in this matter.

I am attaching several of these communications to illustrate these communications. They dont show the hours of telephone holds and conversations with offices from NJ, Pa, Ohio, Utah to name a few. 

This is a GREAT amount of money and has caused us great hardship. It is being held erroneously by Citibank and they refuse to return it.

-XX/XX/XXXX Payment erroneously sent to CitiMortgage XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Oh , XXXX. XXXX Acct No XXXX ( XXXX ) -Numerous conversations with Citibank trying to reverse the error lasting several months. Some conversations lasting hours of hold time.

05/06/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"Good afternoon, I have an AAdvantage credit card, a MasterCard, with Citi Cards. 
I was recently given an increase to {$11000.00} as my credit limit. My previous limit was {$7500.00}. An increase of my credit limit by {$3500.00}. 
On my last statement, I was charged a {$40.00} late fee. I have contacted the customer service line at Citi ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to contest this fee. Citi will not take the charge off despite being a good customer and having been given an increase in my credit limit. 
In XXXX, I made the XXXX payment - my minimum obligation to Citi - of {$220.00}. My check was dated XXXX and was received by Citi and credited to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. ( I live in XXXX and mail delivery is fast here. ) I made another payment to Citi on XX/XX/XXXX at the Citi banking machine ; it was received the same day, XX/XX/XXXX for {$220.00}. This extra XXXX payment was intended for XXXX - made early - because of my concerns about Covid 19 pandemic and getting my XXXX payment in. 
I was told that the second payment in XXXX was credited back to XXXX ; they could not credit that payment of {$220.00} for XXXX. 
I am still employed and working. That said, I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX for {$220.00}. I mailed the payment on XX/XX/XXXX. Citi claims they received the payment on XX/XX/XXXX and sent an email thanking me for that payment. They also charged me the {$40.00} late fee. 
I think that {$40.00} is a lot for a late fee given that I had made a XXXX payment for XXXX. Also, even if Citi can't credit a XXXX payment to XXXX ( especially in these times ) then my XX/XX/XXXX payment should be credited on time. 
I do not understand why my payments to Citi have always been credited quickly and now it's taken Citi almost 15 days to credit my payment to my account. 
I explained to the Citi customer representative that I have been making payments ( 3 payments to Citi in XXXX and XXXX ) but that because Citi is working with a smaller crew, my payment was credited late. 
I sent my payment in ample time but believe that in-house delays at Citi ( smaller staff, working from home, etc. ) has caused the delay. This is not my fault that they credited the payment late. 
I would like my account to be credited the {$40.00} late fee because the delay was not my fault.

03/01/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"I have an account with Home Depot. I had a revolving balance and three promotional balances that were do at different times. On New Years eve I went to my local Home Depot to pay off my revolving balance so no further interest would accrue, and pay towards my XXXX promotional balance. The woman at the customer service counter was unfamiliar with how to do this, so she contacted the national Home Depot credit services department. After speaking with someone there, she passed the phone to me. It was explained to me that because I had a promotional balance due in XXXX, they couldnt pay off the revolving balance first. I complained that XXXX was two months away and that balance was to be paid off by the. The customer service rep told me that their computers would not allow them to divide payments this way. 
In XXXX, when the bill came due I paid off the amount of the remaining revolving balance + extra so it would lessen the XXXX promotional balance. 
When I received my XXXX bill. There was an interest charge of {$10.00}. I called customer service on XX/XX/2020 @ XXXX pm and spoke with XXXX. I explained I was disputing the interest charge due to the fact that I was not allowed by their company to pay off my revolving balance in full the previous month. She spoke to a supervisor who said that they would redirect {$670.00} of my payment of {$790.00} to pay off the revolving balance and remove the {$10.00} interest charge. At that point I was satisfied. 
However, on XXXX XXXX I again called Home Depot Credit Services to verify that all the aforementioned had occurred before I made my XXXX payment. I spoke to XXXX who took a lot of time with me. However, other than removing the interest charge, nothing had changed. I still had a revolving balance, the promotional balance due in XXXX and the one due in XXXX. I explained about the previous conversation I had had with XXXX and what her supervisor had said. She put me on hold, and spoke to someone and was told the same spiel about how because there were 30 days left until the XXXX promotional balance was due, they couldnt pay off the revolving balance first, but instead had to divide up the payment. She apologized, but said there was nothing she could do. I asked what amount I needed to make so I wouldnt accrue interest and could pay off the revolving balance. It seemed the only way to do this was pay the amount of the revolving balance, the total remaining on the XXXX promotional balance, and the XXXX promotional balance. So I did. 
This is a ridiculous scam! If a promotional balance is due on say XX/XX/XXXX, and you pay it off before XX/XX/XXXX, the company should not be allowed to redirect payment from one balance to another. This is just their way of collecting interest. By not allowing me to pay off my revolving balance first, they guaranteed they would continue collecting interest every month.

02/11/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers",Didn't receive advertised or promotional terms,"( 1 ) Citibank is NOT fulfilling the terms of their promotion for new Citi XXXX XXXX Platinum Select Mastercard accounts. On XX/XX/XXXX, in response to a promotional invitation from XXXX XXXX, I applied for a Citi XXXX XXXX Platinum Select Mastercard. The terms of the promotional invitation ( see XXXX ) were that if I spent {$3000.00} on the Citi XXXX XXXX Platinum Select Mastercard within 3 months, I would receive XXXX XXXX XXXX miles. By XX/XX/XXXX ( see credit card statement XXXX ), less than 1.5 months after being approved for the credit card, I had spent {$3300.00} on my Citi XXXX XXXX Platinum Select Mastercard.

As of now ( more than 4 months after I finished spending {$3000.00} on my Citi credit card ), I still have not received my XXXX XXXX XXXX miles. 

( 2 ) After many phone calls and live chats with Citi, I received two letters from Citi dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( see XXXX and XXXX ). Both letters informed me that "" XXXX XXXX AAdvantage bonus miles are not available if you have received a new account bonus for a Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select account in the past 48 months. '' This was the reason why I had not received my XXXX bonus XXXX XXXX miles. 

( 3 ) I am filing this complaint because the terms and conditions of _my_ Citi XXXX XXXX Platinum Select credit card application explicitly did NOT include the language that "" XXXX XXXX AAdvantage bonus miles are not available if you have received a new account bonus for a Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select account in the past 48 months. '' In fact, the major difference between _my_ Citi XXXX XXXX Platinum Select credit card application ( see XXXX ) and the _standard_ Citi XXXX Airlines application ( see XXXX ) is that the 48 month restriction for bonus XXXX XXXX miles appears only on the _standard_ Citi XXXX XXXX   application. In the _standard_ Citi XXXX XXXX application ( see  XXXX ), the second line under the title ( "" Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select World Elite Mastercard '' ) explicitly contains the words : "" XXXX XXXX AAdvantage bonus miles are not available if you have received a new account bonus for a Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select account in the past 48 months. '' However, _my_ application for the Citi XXXX XXXX Platinum Select Mastercard ( see XXXX ), explicitly contains no language anywhere about the 48 month restriction on bonus miles. Unlike the _standard_ application ( see XXXX ) for the Citi XXXX XXXX  Platinum Select Mastercard , the lines under the title ( "" Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select World Elite Mastercard '' ) on _my_ application ( see  XXXX ) make no mention of the 48 month restriction on bonus XXXX XXXX  miles. In fact, this 48 month restriction on bonus miles does not appear _anywhere_ on _my_ Citi credit card application ( XXXX ). 

Thus, the 48 month restriction on bonus XXXX XXXX miles is irrelevant, because it did not appear anywhere on _my_ Citi credit card application ( XXXX ).  Citibank must honor the terms and conditions of _my_ Citi credit card application. 

( 4 ) Since I have fulfilled the terms and conditions of _my_ Citi  XXXX XXXX Platinum Select credit card application , Citibank must credit my XXXX XXXX frequent flier account  with XXXX XXXX XXXX  miles .",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,920XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/11/20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3527504

This letter is to inform you that I XXXX XXXX have been a excellent credit card customer with Goodyear Tires for the past 8 years and present and never had a late payment with Goodyear tire nor any late with any of my credit card companies. 
In Light of the Global Pandemic I experience a difficulty with Goodyear online payment center in trying to make my {$28.00} payment I was not able to log on your system, I try calling could not contact anyone that day of XX/XX/2020 then I continue to call still I could not get in contact with anyone, when I finally got through it was on a recording and I was on hold to speak to alive person for 2 hour. 
When a customer service representative did pick up I informed her of the situation that I was trying to make a payment for the last 3 days and was not able to get through evidently the rep. I was speaking to did not care and I ask her why was my credit card limit was decrease she said the computer automatically decrease my limit from {$2300.00} to {$700.00}. I inform her I was trying to buy a tire because I had an emergency I had a blowout tire on my car I went to Goodyear tires to get the tire fix to learn that I did not have enough money on my credit card to get the tire fix it was so embarrassing that my limit was decrease without forewarning, I ask to be transfer to a supervisors she was very rude to me she indicated to me that my credit was decrease because I was late even though I called 3 or 4 days earlier trying to make a payment and was not able to get through your online system. I finally was able to make my {$28.00} payment. 
Doing this Global Pandemic I understand what we all are experiencing, But I have been an excellent customer with good year tire and I value my credit worthiness I feel I was disrespected and mistreated my Goodyear representatives. Please investigate this matter and please reinstate my credit limit back to {$2300.00}. 
Doing this pandemic even the credit bureaus are not reporting late payments The president of the United States even ask all credit card companies to work with their customers due to this pandemic Please Mr. President on Goodyear tires have your credit department raise my credit limit.

I then contacted Citi Mortgage for advice and was informed that I was eligible for a mortgage assistance program due to the affects of hurricane Irma.

I received a letter from Citi Mortgage stating that my application for mortgage assistance was complete and they received it on XX/XX/XXXX.

02/23/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I am writing regarding the problems I am having with Citibank. They are failing to send me dispute documentation with the merchant 's response. They have issued permanent credits with no additional documentation required, but then have paid merchants on certain transactions as well. Then, they have coded certain disputes as misrepresented. They have failed to send me a proper list of the disputes they claim were misrepresented, so this is leaving me no other choice than to start filing reports with the CFPB on individual disputes, although I am attempting to combine certain ones that have a specific merchant in common are brevities sake. 

This is regarding three disputes with XXXX XXXX XXXX that range from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX : XXXX purchase date, dispute date XXXX, disputed amount {$8.00} XXXX : XXXX purchase date, XXXX dispute date, disputed amount {$8.00} XXXX : XXXX purchase date, XXXX dispute date, disputed amount {$6.00} I dont have the exact details at this point what was purchased, but I can give you two choices : it was either a sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit combo with hash browns and an orange juice ( most likely for XXXX ) or a chicken sandwich combo ( number 1 ) with waffle fries and an iced tea ( most likely large-sized ). 

Back in XXXX, I filed a XXXX  report against XXXX XXXX XXXX for failing to properly replace menu items when they were made incorrectly or utterly rotten and their failure to issue proper refunds. For example, on the XXXX transaction, the sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit was hard as a rock and was dried out. The hash browns were either overcooked or undercooked. They should have issued a full refund or should have replaced the menu items pound per pound, but they didnt. They sent a free coupon for either a plain breakfast sandwich ( no  sausage or cheese ) or a really cheap chicken sandwich and didnt replace the hash browns. I complained to the owners wife, XXXX and their area marketing manager. They both gave the excuse that they were on digital coupons and couldnt process the returns nor could they replace the actual meal that was purchased. I told XXXX and the area marketing manager that failure to replace the items equated to false advertising, and a customer shouldnt have to pay for the food if it isnt made correctly or if it isnt properly replaced. XXXX stated she agreed but she had no control over how refunds were processed or how gift vouchers were sent to customers, because their corporate office was in control of it. I told XXXX I planned on disputing purchases that were not made correctly due to how they were handling the transactions, and XXXX said she would address the disputes when they came in, meaning refunds would be processed this way. I also swore off their store for awhile and purchased their products where I worked : a college campus. 

To date, I have not heard back from Citibank regarding how these disputes were processed. I have asked for all the dispute paperwork as well as the merchants response to the disputes. I was issued permanent credits with no additional documentation required. Citibank never followed up with me if a merchant stated they disagreed with the dispute. I was told by Citibank 's executive office, specifically XXXX, that Citibank had been issuing me credits, but Citibank was also paying the merchants on some transactions. Then, they stated they were just charging off the amount on their P & L sheets and then marking the dispute ( s ) as  misrepresented. Apparently this is some proprietary practice of Citibanks which is utterly laughable ( response to CFPB complaint ) and categorically lazy. And, to date, Citibank has failed to elucidate all the disputes that were coded this way. I have attempted to obtain clarification from Citibank 's billing disputes department over the phone, and different reps give different answers. One recently, XXXX, insisted Citibank would never pay out twice. I asked to speak to her supervisor. She placed me on hold for nearly 30 minutes. I finally terminated the call and wrote another complaint to the CFPB. I have a recording of the call on my smart phone. I would suggest Citibank pull the call records for my account for XXXX around XXXX XXXX. I called from my home phone. It is listed in one of the attachments. I am tired of wasting my time over the phone. In my opinion, Citibank is deliberately wasting my time and refusing to cooperate to resolve these matters. 

Recently, I filed another XXXX  against XXXX XXXX XXXX. A manager, from the store recently got back with me. She told me XXXX XXXX XXXX only recently changed their policy on refunds. I only know this because I had another recent problem that they had to refund. So, between the problems with Citibank and XXXX XXXX XXXX again, I was able to kill two birds with one stone. XXXX further said the digitized coupons caused such a problem ( read all their XXXX  complaints, please ) that corporate office has been working on making vouchers to replace the specific meals, but they still havent gotten them all out yet. I explained to her the problems I have had over the last two years, needing to file disputes due to their lack of in-store refunds and because of failing to award proper gift certificates to replace meals. I also told her I had spoke to XXXX ( the owner 's wife ) in the past, told her I planned on disputing items due to how they were handling the complaints, and that XXXX had stated she would handle the disputes when they came in to the store, meaning refunds would be processed this way. I also told her I had filed a prior XXXX  report, but all of this is in the attached report except for their recent response ; they plan on giving a written explanation in the next few days. I'll happily provide their response to the XXXX  as well if Citibank needs it for their records. 

But, Citibank can verify with the store that these should have been properly refunded through the dispute process. Citibank can verify through the XXXX  report page that I filed a complaint back in XXXX. I am attaching the recent XXXX  report, the original XXXX  report, and screen prints of the dispute summary on all three disputes. The merchant better not have been paid on these transactions and these better not have been coded as misrepresented. If they were, it is going to earn XXXX XXXX XXXX an attorneys general report for false advertising and failure to issue proper refunds. The fur will fly... 

I have attached the following documents : Both XXXX   complaints, the e-mail recently sent to billing disputes with the executive office cc 'd, and screen prints of the dispute summaries.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",KS,660XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/26/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3541207

After the 60 days, it could take up to another 30 days to post to the account. The promotion code I opened the account under was "" XXXX. '' I verified this promotion code through a Citi customer support person via phone call twice to make sure my account was eligible and would be receiving the bonus. They confirmed that it would. 

I contacted Citi on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to follow up and make sure I was still on track for the bonus, as I had read online that other people had issues with actually receiving it. I had one other call that was made to solve a problem I was having with my password, but that was solved without much issue. 

I logged into my account on XX/XX/XXXX to find both my savings and checking accounts closed with no reason given. I checked my email and there was nothing there, either. I received no notice or reason for my account closures. I had to open the customer service Live Chat again to speak with someone who told me that there was no reason for the account closure listed. They asked me to call the account opening department, which at that time had a wait of 881 minutes. How am I realistically supposed to wait that long? 

Apparently, they put my life savings in the mail and couldn't provide me a tracking number. So, it was either wait 881 minutes to try and get a tracking number from a real person or wait for my checks to arrive in the mail. Which, they finally did. 

And when both checks ( mailed separately ) arrived, there was STILL no reason for the account closures. I STILL don't know why Citi closed my accounts and is trying to avoid giving me what I am owed. 

I finally got someone through Citi 's "" XXXX '' XXXX account, who followed up with me by phone after the fact. They still couldn't give me a reason for the closures, and assured me that they would be opening an investigation into the issue. This investigation was supposedly opened on XX/XX/XXXX and I was told it could take up to 20 days to resolve. 

I feel like I am being given the run-around. I just want what I am owed.

I have had this account for 5+ years, always in good standing, never a time where I did not pay or became delinquent or had any issues reported on the account. I got an email stating my account was late and they refunded the late fee because I have never missed a payment. When I first got this, I was do grateful and happy they were proactive with that.

'' My credit utilization has been the same for the last 2-3 years. This particular account has not been used for many many months as a way to positively impact my credit utilization. By Citi taking this adverse action at a time of a global pandemic and lowering my credit, it puts me in a worse position because my credit utilization, which they sight as the reason for the adverse action and reducing my line actually makes my credit utilization WORSE. It is unfair and unethical to impact customers in good standing during a time of national and global crisis while at the same time publicly stating Citi is here to help people impacted. This type of adverse action is uncalled for.

XX/XX/XXXX was the last day able to get into online account. I tried to access through mobile app which seems to be working but I can not get in touch with citi via phone or through the messaging in the app. Every time you call it makes you go through all these prompts for 5 mins and then loops you back and says sorry please call back. This has been going on for weeks. Tried to message them through app XX/XX/XXXX afternoon to find out about the site being down still plus what they are doing for people affected by covid.

I made use of a 0 % balance transfer/purchase rate from Citicards a few months back with the understanding it would expire in XXXX, 2020. 
2. In the meantime, I have never made late payments and have been an outstanding customer for Citi over the years.

3. I had about {$5600.00} on the card in XXXX, whose promo rate was set to expire in XXXX. I proactively called Citi customer service and spoke with a manager and asked about extending the low interest rate or any other savings options available in light of COVID-19 4. I was advised in that ( recorded ) phone call that I would need to call back in one month when the cycle had ended, so that I could obtain relief. Relief measures included extending the same low interest rate for a few more months or transferring me over to a similar, low rate ( close to 0 % which was currently on the account ). 
5. I asked the agent to make notes in their system reflecting my detailed conversation.

6. I duly called back on XX/XX/2020. The agent advised me that there were no notes in the system reflecting any of my previous conversation or request in XXXX. 
7. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor. I was given a supervisor by the name of "" XXXX '' with whom I spoke ( after obtaining clearances to speak as an "" authorized user '' on the account ). 
8. XXXX told me there were no notes in the system and that she was unable to grant me any offers ( either as extensions or as low rates close to what I had been using thus far ).

9. Considering that I was specifically promised relief and considering Citi 's own self-announced relief for cardholders, and considering that I had not been in default, and considering my card loyalty for many years, I found Citi 's position aggressive, unyielding, tone-deaf and patently unfair.

We spent well over an hour on the phone today arguing with Macy's/XXXX XXXX telephone operators in the XXXX ( because apparently American big business interests have written off investing in this country and choose to invest in overseas telephone call centers instead ) trying to describe the adverse financial consequences we will now experience with a likely lowered credit rating ( and higher interest rates ) when we apply for a mortgage in the near future. And of course, nobody in XXXX really grasped how this was a problem, nor could they explain why it was done or what our recourse was, nor how we could communicate directly with executives in XXXX XXXX in order to plead our case. 
6. Lastly, and most disgusting of all is the fact that these despicable and arbitrary actions are taking place in the middle of the global plague that the XXXX XXXX Government has unleashed on the world. People are literally dying around the globe and entire industries are going under, and we're on the edge of a recession or ( possibly ) even a depression. People are under a lot of stress, and the thoughtless actions of this credit card company are not helpful. I find it hard to comprehend how they failed ( and continue to fail ) their customers, and their behavior especially at this time is hard to comprehend.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",WA,992XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,03/26/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3578985
06/08/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"CitiCard has recently implemented a new policy that does not allow customers to pay their full bill. This affects all CitiCard card holders. I have been a Citicard customer for many years. This new billing policy needs to be brought to light in that it disregards the billing periods and prevents customers from paying their paper statement in full. Please see attached documents to help explain whats happening. This affects ALL their credit card customers. 

Instead of normal practices where a customer receives a paper statement & can pay the entire bill at the end of the billing period, they are refusing to accept my full payment. They send me a paper statement which clearly sets out the cutoff dates of the beginning & end of the billing period & the amount due for all transactions during that period. For years I have chosen to pay my bill in full online at the end of each billing period. 

The new policy mandates that I can only pay the amount that is on the computer screen at the date & time I want to pay it. However, that balance includes all credits that took place AFTER the close of the billing period shown on my paper statement. Because the computer balance is live, the balance changes in real time thereby creating a continuous discrepancy between my paper statement & the online balance. The computer will not accept the amount due on my paper statement. 

Under the new CitiCard billing policy, if I return and item an item AFTER my billing period has ended, the computer balance immediately shows the credit on the account and calculates a different amount due for the bill Ive already received. Those daily transactions that take place after the billing period belong on the next billing period to appear for the next paper bill. Under the new policy, if I return an item to a vendor anytime after my billing period has ended and then try to pay my bill from my paper statement, even though CitiCard received that credit in a different billing period ( a week into the next bill ) my present paper statement due for prior transactions BEFORE the cutoff date is not longer recognized as valid. 

This new policy of manipulating funds by slipping future credits into prior billing periods may have some sort of financial advantage to them, but its depriving me of my rights as a consumer. I have the right to be accurately billed for each transaction within the billing periods which they set, and they should be required to accept the payment for the billing period which I was billed. If Im billed a specific amount, but only pay a lesser amount each month, my records dont reconcile, because there is no record to justify the discrepancy between the statement & the amount paid. How do I explain that to IRS? 

I keep strict financial records and depend on that paper bill ( which is my only proof of the specific transactions and dollar amounts that support what I owe for a certain period ) to reconcile all accounts. CitiCard refuses to accept my payment in full for my paper bill. Isnt that the purpose of a paper statement? Their computer payment site is specifically set up to only accept what the running balance is as of the day & time I try to pay it. 

Last month, I tried to make a full payment. The computer refused to accept the full amount of $ XXXXand I spent a lot of time trying to enter it. I tried to contact them but after several attempts of being left on hold for more than 15-20 minutes & having the call dropped, I gave up and just clicked to pay the {$43.00} the computer would accept. Unknown to me at the time, the computer didnt even transmit the payment even though it was for the {$43.00} it wanted me to pay. 

Upon receiving my next paper statement I discovered that they included the charge for the full amount of {$98.00} and added late fees, interest and penalties for that prior bill, indicating that they never received my prior payment for and penalized me for not paying on time, but the computer would still not allow a full payment of my current paper bill. Since my current bill is due very soon, I persevered and finally got a human on the phone and spoke to the customer care rep and then a member of the escalation team. They reiterated that I could only pay the amount that shows on the computer on the day and time I pay the bill. They did allow me to pay the {$98.00} over the phone for the prior bill but would not remove the penalty fees and still refused to accept a phone payment or any other form of payment for the full amount of my current statement. They were very adamant that their billing policy supersedes the paper statement. I must pay what the computer reflects and that if I didnt pay what the computer balance shows on the day and time I pay it, I will continue to be charged interest and penalties and there was nothing I could do about it. I then asked if they would accept the amount on the paper bill if I sent a check. They said no, the policy holds. I spoke with the XXXX the Customer Care Rep & then requested a supervisor. I dont remember his name, but he was from the Escalation Team! I was promised that I would get a call from Escalation Team 2 the following Monday or Tuesday - never happened. I tried to call them again to get a payment history, but I was left on hold until it dropped my call. 

My present paper statement due XX/XX/20 is {$290.00} but as you can see on the computer balance at this moment is {$190.00} & the computer will not accept {$290.00}. Time is important to this resolution. I have 3 accounts with this company, which means that until I get this straightened out, I will have to pay them interest and penalties on all 3. This policy puts all customers and their credit ratings at risk.

I asked if I could file another dispute since the host says she agreed to fully reimburse me but Citi declined another dispute stating the dispute was still being investigated. I then checked my online account on XX/XX/XXXX for something else, and noticed I had messages where I found a XX/XX/XXXX notification from Citicard stating exactly the opposite of what I was told over the phone by Citi on XX/XX/XXXX : The investigation is closed as XXXX   reimbursed me {$630.00} + {$79.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. After weeks of debating with Citicard/bank, as I initially could not find the XX/XX/XXXX refund, I questioned what happened to the XXXX as I am shocked that I received another Citicard/Citibank notification stating CitiBank sided in favor of XXXX. How does a credit card side with stealing XXXX from a customer that 1. Did not travel due to travel restrictions and a global pandemic and 2.  Was informed by the owner of the vacation property she agreed to reimburse me 100 % due to the pandemic. So why would XXXX be allowed to steal XXXX from me..this is money I could use to pay my cable bill, UI bill or another bill that are now piling up due to decreased work hours and ineligibility for the economic impact payment. On XX/XX/XXXX I was informed by a CitiBank/Citicard Executive office employee, XXXX, that Citi cant force XXXX to change their policies. However, I dont agree with this statement as my XXXX card sided in favor with me for a full refund of XXXX which was a payment for a timeshare vacation scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX, that was also cancelled by travel restrictions and CoVid19.  Two credit cards with two different resolutions : XXXX card successfully fought and won a FULL refund for their loyal customer ( me ) after siding in my favor instead of siding in favor of the the travel company and Citi card let XXXX steal XXXX from me by shockingly siding in XXXX   favor. I was told by XXXX and also XXXX  that XXXX offered a XXXX credit to me which expires in XX/XX/XXXX, so they gave you money per XXXX of Citibank/credit Executive office, but I had to inform XXXX that I would like my money back and not a credit for a vacation that I will never take since there is no resolution to the CoVid pandemic and probably wont be one until a vaccine is created which definitely wont be by XX/XX/XXXX. After speaking with CitiCard/bank I called XXXX and basically was told the same thing we can not reimburse you but did provide you with a credit of {$180.00}. As recently stated, I will not be traveling anytime soon due to a chronic health condition that puts me in a high risk category to suffer debilitating complications if infected with the CoVid. All I want is my XXXX back which again can be used towards my plethora of bills instead pf a XXXX credit that I will never use. Thank you federal government for helping me to get the XXXX off my CitiBank card just like XXXX card refused to allow a travel company to take money from me for a vacation that was cancelled by CoVid19.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CT,None,None,Consent provided,Web,05/22/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3665597

These restrictions are outlined in the Citi/AAdvantage card promotional bonus offer terms and conditions, as well as at the top of each application page.

Every single credit card I applied for was vetted and approved by Citibank. I put in all my information, social, address name, etc. None of the applications had any language about 48-months or anything about already receiving a bonus. 

I received the bonuses for all credit cards opened for XXXX XXXX Platinum cards from Citibank because I was in line with the terms and conditions, they did not state anything about getting multiple bonuses nor a timeframe in which it could be done. 

I have attached multiple examples of the Citibank XXXX  XXXX offer that does not have the terms and conditions at the top of the application page. Along with an application I saved as a PDF, that clearly doesn't say anything about 48-months or any restrictive terms.

In XXXX of XXXX they charged me for an annual fee that I was not expecting. I had not paid an annual fee when opening the account in XXXX so either this was waived for the first year or they later started charging an annual fee. I never received a bill for this charge. In XXXX of XXXX I used the card for the first time and later in that same month I received a bill / late notice from Citibank in the mail.

In XXXX of XXXX I checked my credit and was shocked at seeing my credit score 80 points lower than last time I checked. I then discovered that the reason was the late payment on this credit card. I called Citibank to find out what this was about and how to correct it and was basically told that nothing could be done. 

I then started a dispute with each of the three credit bureaus. I explained the situation, and that I could not understand how I could be considered late for not paying a bill that I was unaware of ( the annual fee ) and that I never received a copy of ( no paper statement, no email ). I further explained, as they can see, that I have never had a late payment in over 30 years of credit history. The answer back from each of the credit bureaus is that they contacted Citibank and were told that the report was correct, so they were not going to change anything. 

It seems to me that the dispute path is just a waste of time if all they do is ask the company if they are right and ignore the fact that I take issue with how the company mishandled the situation.

In XXXX Citibank entered delinquencies on my credit card account, even though the account was involved in fraud. Citibank had incorrectly changed my billing and email addresses. They sent my billing statements with {$20.00} due to the wrong address ( in another state ) for 4 months. When I finally received the bill I immediately paid the {$20.00}. They also billed me {$150.00} in overdue charges and fees. After much discussion one group dropped the charges but another sent in 3 - 6 months delinquencies on my account. This amounted to my credit rating being dropped over 70 points and the marks against me being on my credit record for 7 years. 

After receiving correspondence from the CFPB, Citibank rectified the issue and on XX/XX/XXXX the credit Bureaus corrected the problem. My credit rating raised to over 800 ( Excellent ) - which is what it had been for years. 

On XX/XX/XXXX Citibank resubmitted the original false delinquencies to the bureaus and my credit rating was reversed to the 700 's ( good ). XXXX  reviewed my file and the letters from Citibank to remove the delinquencies. They contacted Citibank and Citibank again refuses to correct the problem.

I was guaranteed by the credit account manager that the Home Depot would never change account terms to add full back interest after the two year promotion date was over. Specifically he said that "" The Home Depot cares too much for its customers to do that '' and that my account was "" Two years no interest '' and that my concern was "" two years deferred interest ''. THAT IS HOW HE SOLD ME ON CREATING AN ACCOUNT. Additionally, since I spend so much time TDY away from home, I have always set up payments so that purchases will be payed off in full before the end of two years. this method of managing my account has worked well for ten years with no problems until now. I don't know what went wrong. The auto payment were not nearly as agreed, in fact Citi made them digressive until the end of the two years and then added the full back interest to the principle. This is terrible PREDATORY lending and an internet search reveals Citi as absolutely famous for this. I contacted them when I learned about this and asked them to contact me to discuss it. No one contacted me. They just left me a message that they turned down my request. ( Which I hadn't even had a chance to explain yet ) Now, over a year later I have had some time to re-visit the issue and when I contacted Citi executives I was told that it had been too long ( even though I first contacted them when it happened ) and that it was my fault since I "" chose not to manage my account ''. 
I don't deserve this. NO ONE DOES. 

1 I have excellent credit and have never missed a payment so why are Predatory Banks like City allowed to charge any interest rate they please?? 
2 why can Banks change the terms of credit accounts as the please and then tell me that "" they sent me letter '' informing me of the change in terms?? Should notification methods be adiquate for EVERYONE, even if some people spend much time away from their place of residence. Why can't changes REQUIRE a confirmation.

I called in immediately to rectify the situation.

01/28/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"On XX/XX/XXXX, while working on my taxes and going through my credit card statements, I noticed a charge on my Best Buy Credit Card Statement that fluctuated month to month. I normally just pay my account online each month and unfortunately don't pay close attention to the statement. I have purchased numerous items over the years from best buy that including a warranty ( such as XXXX, computers, televisions etc ) so if I noticed a charge on my account over the years I assumed it was for one of  these. When I began to really closely review my account statements I noticed I was charged the fluctuating fee every month all the way back to as far as my statements would pull up online (XX/XX/XXXX ). There is a number next to the charge that states to call this number concerning this fee and not the Best Buy Consumer Card number. I called this number and questioned the charge and I was notified at the beginning of the call that the call was to be recorded so the company should have the recording. I inquired about the charge and when it was added to my account and asked how is was authorized to be put on my account. The representative told me I had been charged for debt protection and the charges began in XX/XX/XXXX when I opened the card. I told the rep, that I had NEVER authorized this charge and I wanted to dispute it and wanted all of the charges refunded back to XX/XX/XXXX. She asked if I wanted to cancel the debt protection and I said yes ( I never authorized it to begin with ), she then told me that she would cancel it, and she would have all of the charges removed and I would see this reflected on my next statement. Meanwhile I called Best Buy Consumer Card Service number and notified them of the fraudulent charges and my disappointment, I then inquired about the about interest that has been charged against this monthly fraudulent charge since XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me he could reverse the recent amount of 41.00 interest charged but that would be all he could do so I told him I would wait until the refund was made and then speak with someone else concerning the interest on the charges. I then messaged Best Buy online and asked to be mailed copies of all of my statements that weren't available online past XX/XX/XXXX. I  received those statements in the mail today ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ), XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX was not included in the mailing ( most likely because XXXX was over the card through those years and sold to Citi in XX/XX/XXXX ). I received an online message through my account stating that the debt protection was cancelled but the funds would not be refunded to me. From the statements that I have dating back to XX/XX/XXXX, I have been charged XXXX for these fraudulent debt protection fees on the statements that I have and there's no telling how much more for the three years I don't have available. I went online researching this matter and it's clear I'm not the only person that this has happened to. This is a widespread matter that needs to be investigated and stopped. I expect for these fees to be fully refunded and my account credited the full amount and the interest amount that was charged against these fees refunded as well. Best Buy, Citi nor any third party company has any documentation of my authorization for this debt protection or the fees associated with it.

02/08/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"I am Citi Card member since XXXX. I am a fan HOWEVER When accessing my Citi Bank credit card account online on XX/XX/XXXX I chose the option to pay my current balance which is generated by the computer system. I paid the current balance leaving the card with a XXXX  balance. 
Ive since found charges from the closeing statement on my card and could not figure out why the numbers did not work. 
I then called Citibank for clarification. The reason they gave was due a gray area where they said that even though I paid my current balance online its really a statement balance So thats why the balance didnt include the charges after the last statement which ended on XX/XX/XXXX ... soo not a current balance?? or as the website current balance disclaimer says This is the current balance on the account today including any remaining balances from the previous statements close date. Does not include any pending or interest fees. Also warns you not paying your balances in full. Ok so then how do I know what to pay so I dont get charged. 

So the discrepancy I was complaining about were the charges ocurred on the XXXX and throughXXXX that were not included on the online current balance XXXX payment. 
Even though it says it is the current balance.and even though the statement end as the XXXX? The representative said I should be able to figure it out ... from what the limited information Citi provides listing all charges by date but not by when it actually occured ... REALLY???? impossible to figure out. 

Additionally, the system does not give me the option to pay my last statement as opposed to my current balance it does not say anything regarding differences in balances. 

I complained to Citibank clarified to them that I am paying online and not by paper. I complained about the difference experience between paper and online statements. 
The supervisor that I spoke to named XXXX number XXXX said he would forward the complaint and apologized for the misleading information on the online account. 
I called today XX/XX/2020 at XXXX and spoke to citibank for 47 minutes. 

It is so difficult to figure out because the difference between the current balance and statement balance are not clearly stated. I tired but couldnt find any information anywhere to quantify the balances shown. Impossible to figure out. 

This is not the only credit card that this is happening to my fianc also is having the same exact issues with XXXX  XXXX XXXX. 

The banks then are charging fees if we dont pay off our full balance due but how can we pay off our balance when it is not clearly stated and we have no idea what our final balances are. 

So if I pay on the XXXX I do not expect the purchases I made on the XXXX to appear after that date. 
Lets get crazy and consider if it takes the bank 4 days post a payment ( in this day and age ) is that not something that should the consumer should be made aware of? and should the consumer be penalized for that as well? How are we supposed to figure our balances out? 
Should be plain and simple not hidden or need a accounting degree to figure out. 
Since the inception of computers and programs that allow us to be responsible and pay our bills ontime to avoid fees however that doesnt make banks money and I believe they made this intentionally deceptive and confusing.

04/14/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"The Home Depot is always sending me advertisements/receipts to my e-mail account. 
Since I'm now working from home, I'm doing other work around the house ( CORONA = SHELTER IN PLACE ) ; so when I saw another "" HOME DEPOT '' on XX/XX/XXXX, I opened it ( thinking it's another advertisement ), but it was a "" MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE ALERT '' Statement Balance : {$2800.00} Minimum Due : {$84.00} Payment Due Date : XX/XX/XXXX Last Payment Amount : {$81.00} NOTE : I DON'T REMEMBER SENDING THIS! 

ACTION TAKEN BY ME : I called Home Depot XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX & tried to explain to a Supervisor ( 1st CallXXXX = DISCONNECTED/HUNG-UP on me? ) that I NEVER received my statements in order to monitor my account & the "" PROMOS '', & he said that I signed up for "" PAPERLESS BILLING '' when you "" REGISTERED '' your # XXXX account. I NEVER REGISTERED FOR THIS ACCOUNT. 
We went back & forth with this argument ( in a CIVILIZED discussion ), which went NOWHERE! In order to avoid any more accruing interest, while I investigate further, I paid the ENTIRE BALANCE OFF! 
Payment Amount : {$2800.00} Payment Date : XXXX XXXX EDT Confirmation Number : XXXX After further investigation, I found that I did open AN ACCOUNT on line back in XXXX. 
However, that was for a FORMER ACCOUNT # XXXX which was subsequently CLOSED! I found this out by trying to log-on to the ACCOUNT ( in question ) # XXXX, but I could NOT log-on! Why? Citi-Bank ( Holder of Home Depot accounts ) stated that I "" NEVER REGISTERED THIS ACCOUNT ''. If I "" NEVER REGISTERED THE ACCOUNT '', then how did I "" AGREE TO PAPERLESS STATEMENTS ''? You MUST be "" REGISTERED '' in order to receive "" PAPERLESS STATEMENTS ''. 

Home Depot stated that I signed up for "" Paperless Statements '' to receive my monthly bills, & that I also agreed to paying ONLY the "" minimum amount due '' to be withdrawn from my bank account ( XXXX XXXX ) monthly. These are false statements, for I never agreed to have my Home Depot account # ending in XXXX follow these guidelines. They have been taking between {$60.00} & {$90.00} out of my XXXX  account # ending in XXXX since XXXX, XXXX. I would NOT notice these small amounts taken out for 3 reasons : 1st : When I log-on to my XXXX XXXX the first thing I see is my checking balance, & then I go to "" BILL PAY '' ; Open my "" PAPER '' bills, from OTHER "" PAYEES '' = Pay them. 
2nd : When I look at my "" Checking Statement '', I see "" CHECK XXXX '' under the heading 'description ', & - {$84.00} under the heading 'Debit/Credit '. It is NOT 'described ' as "" HOME DEPOT '' ; you must 'click on ' "" view check details '' in or to see that it's made out to "" HOME DEPOT ''. That's the system for ANY written check. How do I know whether/not my wife didn't write the check. 
3rd : It's really NOT a SUBSTANTIAL amount of money, that could be EASILY overlooked. Which helps Home Depot & leads into the following. 
I believe they used a system of deceptive techniques prior XX/XX/XXXX : 1 ) I paid previously by phone to pay a bill & gave them my XXXX XXXX routing & account numbers. They now have these numbers. 
2 ) Since I buy goods utilizing their 6,12, or 24 month NO INTEREST PROMOTION plans, they waited until I was well into ( +/- a few months ) paying off the 1st PROMO. ( I used more than 1 PROMO over years ) 3 ) They stopped sending me "" PAPER STATEMENTS '', took "" MINIMUM PAYMENTS '' out of my XXXX XXXX XXXX account ( WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION ) every month, & stated "" PAY BY PHONE '' on statements I NEVER received. 
4 ) Since they were NO longer sending "" PAPER STATEMENTS '', I was thinking that my "" AUTOPAY '' in XXXX XXXX paid/was paying the debts off. 
5 ) As a result the ( 21.99 % INTEREST RATE ON ) "" PROMOTIONAL BALANCES '' ( There were 6 in all ) missed their expiration dates, & XXXX in deferred interest charges were applied to my account, totaling {$1300.00}. Also, these overlapping fees are NOW part of the "" REVOLVING BALANCE '' AT 21.99 %.

The charge was on XXXX, it was disputed on XXXX, and a permanent credit with no additional documentation was issued in my favor on XXXX. I am submitting additional documentation for your records for Citbank 's record 's because billing disputes doesn't seem to be doing their jobs properly. 

As you can see, my copay was {$10.00}, but XXXX XXXX billed me {$20.00} in error. I reported the problem to XXXX XXXX and they failed to reverse the charge, so I disputed it. Over two months later, within the dispute period, XXXX XXXX finally issued a credit to my account on XXXX. So they were obviously alerted by Citibank to the continued problem with the billing error and credited the account. But it appears Citibank had yet to catch their credit because the disputed history still showed the amount as permanent on XXXX. I figured Citibank would eventually reverse the charge, honestly forgot about it as well, but Citibank didn't reverse it until I withdrew it and notified them in writing. 

I am assuming Citibank didn't catch it is because it was listed as a permanent credit? I tried to search for a {$10.00} rebill through Citibank 's transaction history, but I was never able to find one at the time because their website kept kicking me out and sporadically would not perform searches properly So, I ended up having to comb through my statements that I have saved for my records. I still can not find a rebill for {$10.00}. 

I also need to verify that this charge was not listed as misrepresented. If it was listed as misrepresented, I will need to take it up with XXXX XXXX 's as well at the state healing board. 

I am including the following documentation : a copy of the XXXX XXXX 's dispute, a copy of their eventual credit dated XXXX, my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX claim, the XXXX XXXX 's withdraw, the XXXX XXXX 's rebill that shows a posted date of XXXX ( this is well before my withdrawal dated XXXX, so I am unclear why they used this date ), and a screen print of the alert I sent to billing dispute.

04/14/20,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive enough information to verify debt,"I, XXXX XXXX have tried to protect my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ), and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). The damages done to me under a legitimate identity theft claim in unprecedented. I am a XXXX single mother, working full time raising children to believe in the American system. Yet, national banks can make moves against me as an individual for collection on debts that could have easily been made whole by filing claims through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). In XXXX I did everything by the book by submitting an identity claim filed with my local police department, stating that a family friend had acquired several of my credit cards, and ran them up on charges without my knowledge. Identity theft is a federal crime, 18 U.S. Code 1028A. Aggravated identity theft, see recent USA v. Soffan ( 3:19-cr-30004 ), Massachusetts District Court , Filed : XX/XX/XXXX. This individual received several years in federal prison as a sentence and hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution for the same crime procured against me. Yet, the person who committed identity theft against me has never been question by a federal agent or arrested for a malicious crime where I along with my entire family has been financially harmed. The national banks on the other hand have been in a position to erase these debs against me through a claim under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act. His law was implemented in XXXX by the United States Congress as a protective means against identity theft, yet it has little effect in general. The local Soffan case is an example, identity theft is run on a rather large scale in my general region. My research has shown that each of these credit card debts went through several stages, or at least should have gone through before any legitimate collection process could begin. That criteria are as follows : 1 ) My original credit approval submitted a credit card in my name for usage in purchasing goods and services. 
2 ) The line of credit was packaged into a securitization in a pooling and servicing agreement, governed through the Securities and Exchange Commission, and sold off as secured receivables through such pooling and servicing agreements, normally in the XXXX XXXX   dollar amounts or greater, particular securitization not researched. When any credit card went 120-days into default, then under Regulation 5000 the account is classified as sub-standard charge off status. Upon that time the receivable is reversed out of any securitized trust, WILLARD v. BANK OF AMERICA, CIVIL ACTION NO. 16-01199, and the original lending party become responsible for payment enforcement, unless the original debt is sold to a third-party under guidelines of

Henson v. Santander Consumer USA, NA., whereas if that was the case then my rights under FDCPA are VOID. ( See Attached US Supreme Court Decision June 12, 2017. 3 ) All banks in my identity theft took zero action to see that the person responsible be brought to justice like Mr. XXXX. I believe that racism has played a major part in not protecting my rights under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ), and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). This is not acceptable under any circumstances. 
4 ) I will submit a complaint to the Massachusetts Office of Attorney General as well as the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, as I can prove that the lack of honesty in going through protocol was ignored based upon my race. 
5 ) At all times since the original creditor was reassigned ownership of these debts from a securitized trust did any of the bank concerns, or collection agencies file a claim with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ), but the same banks had no problem destroying my personal credit rating, making it impossible for me to obtain mortgage approval to buy a home in a safe neighborhood.

6 ) These debt collections must be deleted permanently from all pertinent credit reporting agencies. All securitizations are self-insured through their credit ratings, insuring a premium on each pooling agreement package that is 100 % profit to all banks packaging securitizations. I filed an identity theft claim with all national banks, and I was ignored completely. I demand the removal of theses collections, the purging of my information on file, and a cease and desist from any further collection attempt, including but no limited to calls made to my cell phone and employment.

04/06/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I am writing to file a complaint against Citibanks incomplete and inaccurate response dated XX/XX/XXXX2020. Citibanks response, dated XX/XX/XXXX2020, stated that the charge of XXXX 's transaction in the amount of {$1500.00} can not be considered fraudulent and that they may require to report my account as past due to the consumer reporting agencies. Citibank has entirely missed the point and seemed to have mishandled my complaint of XX/XX/XXXX2020. I am of the opinion that Citibank has reached the wrong conclusions ; that may be due to an underlying failure to perform proper due diligence - review and investigate the matter. 
On XX/XX/XXXX2020, I filed a complaint with CFPB ( previous CFPB complaint id # XXXX ) against Citibank regarding a transaction with XXXX for an amount of {$1500.00}. The reason was for not receiving service from the merchant ; however, Citibanks response indicates that this charge can not be considered fraudulent. In summary, the merchant unilaterally canceled my reservation without notification and my consent on XX/XX/XXXX2020, some hours before my departure time. I only discovered their cancellation of my tickets when I tried to check-in and reserve seats. I planned to fly with XXXX tickets, but the tickets were canceled by them. Without a confirmed ticket, what service did I receive from the merchant? None. 
Its simple : XXXX took my money, and XXXX provided no tickets for my flights. So, my dispute for the charges to my credit card are for bad service/no service from XXXX -- why does Citibank choose to close the complaint by explaining the actions of XXXX were not fraudulent? 
Citibank further indicates my credit rating may suffer. This also seems wrongheaded by Citibank. I take pains to keep my account in good standing. It has always been in good standing for all these years. My payments are always on time. Even though I did not receive the service from XXXX, I still made my full payment on time because I don't like outstanding balance and pay hefty interest. I received the Citibank statement for the XXXX transaction in XXXX with a due date of XX/XX/XXXX2020. The payment was cleared on XX/XX/XXXX2020. Proof of payment was included on the XX/XX/XXXX2020 submission. There is no outstanding item in my account ; therefore, why is my account being report to the credit agencies? Because of Citibanks irresponsible action, it appears my credit score has dropped to XXXX from XXXX. My understanding of the consumer protection laws is that Citibank must provide accurate information and it must take prompt actions to correct its errors. 
Citibank should not rely on the outdated info and conclude their investigation without conducting a current review of my account and documents. Citibank indicated that they received a valid ticket info from the merchant. The tickets were valid from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, but the merchant unilaterally canceled my tickets on XX/XX/XXXX late afternoon. My departure date was XX/XX/XXXX. If the tickets were valid as Citibank indicated, why did I rebook another 2 tickets cost twice the amount of the XXXX tickets? I am not a bank and every penny is my hard earned money. It would not take long for an employee of Citibank to XXXX Customer complaints XXXX and discover that other travelers have experienced problems with this merchant ; this is a fact and it adds credibility to my complaint about bad service/no service by this merchant. I only found out about XXXX service problems after I had booked my tickets. 
It seems Citibank closed the complaint based on their outdated comments dated on XX/XX/XXXX, 2020. I can say on a positive note that Citibanks representatives have generally been courteous, but their conclusion of this matter seems dead wrong. Each time I speak to the representative I am provided with inconsistent information. I strongly suggest that Citibank provides comprehensive training to its customer representative to avoid misleading information given to customers.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,113XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/06/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3595266

04/11/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted 2 disputes, relative to a reservation and stay at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, to my credit card company, Citibank. The original reservation was lost by the vendor and we were given horribly substandard accommodations which were significantly worse than what had been advertised. This was despite being assured multiple times by the hotel that the accommodations would be comparable, once they determined that they had mistakenly reserved us for one year later. We were not allowed to view the accommodations, until the time of check-in, which was at closing time for management. We immediately presented proof to the hotel reception staff that the accommodations we were given were far inferior to what had been advertised at the time of reservation. We were not given an opportunity to discuss this with management, despite multiple efforts and multiple assurances from the reception staff, that we would be given an opportunity and a monetary adjustment would be made. At checkout, the hotel would not give us an invoice to see the charges, and again denied us the opportunity to speak with management. They made multiple assurances throughout out stay that management would contact us immediately to discuss this. 

At the time of submission of a request for chargeback to Citibank, according to their instructions, and in good faith, I provided a detailed letter of what had occurred and my failed attempts to speak with the management. I provided a prodigious amount of photo documentation and descriptions, including square footage, showing what had been advertised and reserved through XXXX, and what was actually provided. 
The dispute was divided into 2 separate charges, since I initially paid XXXX XXXX a portion of the total at the time of reservation in XX/XX/XXXX. The second charge was made to my Citibank Credit Card, without any further authorization, at the time of checkout, XX/XX/XXXX. The hotel refused to give me an invoice or allow me to speak with management at the time of checkout. As I was instructed, I submitted both disputes via email to dispute department at Citibank, XXXX  

On XX/XX/XXXX, Citibank sent an electronic message and posted a reply for the second charge. It was dated 3 days after the message itself was dated. Two messages were posted for the same chargeback. The second dispute was missing. I contacted the dispute department and was told that I should immediately sign and send back the response form, in order to have the dispute continued further. I pointed out that only one dispute number was posted, and they assured me that they were not aware of this and would post the second dispute within 48 hours. I received the second response over a week later. In responses, the vendor simply provided a signed key receipt as proof that I had agreed to pay for the rooms provided. I had not agreed to anything except that I would be given a comparable suite and on that basis, I signed for the key. I was given the key receipt prior to being able to see the substandard room. No monetary amount was noted or agreed to on the Hotel 's documentation. No signed invoice was provided, because I was never given one. In the hotels response, they alleged that I had discussed this with them when I had not. 

When I called Citibank, I was told that I should send any additional information that would prove that the accommodations provided were not the ones for which I had agreed to pay. I explained that I had already submitted these, but would be happy to resubmit them. They responded that I did not need to resubmit the information I had already submitted. I was told that the charges would continue to be reversed until further information and the signed responses were received and a resolution was done. On XX/XX/XXXX, on Citibanks secured server, I submitted signed response letters for each of the disputes with detailed letters rebutting the vendors allegations. In the letter, I referred to the previously submitted documentation and offered to re-send it if necessary. It appeared that none of my copious documentation had been reviewed by Citibank Disputes Department and that Citibank was willing to believe the extremely scant documentation provided by the hotel. 

On XXXX, when preparing to pay my bill, I noted that the charges still appeared on my statement. I had received only emails stating that they had received my additional information and would be contacting me soon. I made multiple calls to Citibank over several hours and was disconnected after a recorded statement that was made that all agents were busy. I checked the website messages and no further messages appeared regarding the status of either of these disputes. I finally got through, explained the situation to the agent, and she said that someone from disputes would contact me within 48 hours on my cellphone to update me further. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email alert that a letter was available in messages on the website. I found two letters, once again referring to the same dispute, but not referring to the other dispute. It stated that since I had not provided any information proving that the services rendered were not the ones delivered, that the dispute was considered resolved and the chargeback was reversed. I have spent hours trying to re-contact Citibank to get some explanation of this decision and to find out if they had indeed reviewed all of the documentation I submitted. I have been repeatedly disconnected. 

If the credit card company resolves a dispute, I should be able to understand the basis on which they did so. I should able to confirm that they received and have thoroughly reviewed the documentation that I submitted. I understand that the CoVid19 crisis makes it difficult to contact the company, however this should not be an excuse for their making a decision, clearly without having reviewed my evidence or not clearly explaining their reasons for making the decision despite copious evidence on my part and invalid evidence on the part of the vendor. 


Please note that the attachments I have provided, are identical for both disputes, numbers : XXXX and XXXX. Therefore, rather than duplicate, I will send only one set. The first XXXX photos depict the original listing 900 square foot 1 bedroom villa, which was the basis for my making the reservation and deposit. Photos 1-12 show the room which was given to us, which was less than 1/2 the size of what we contracted for ; very dark, unventilated due to the lack of privacy and need to keep the bedroom windows closed, and very loud due to the location next to a common walkway and with the front door across from the bed, at the top of a common stairway.

04/17/20,Checking or savings account,CD (Certificate of Deposit),Closing an account,Company closed your account,"I opened a 1 year XXXX ( 2.5 % interest rate ) with Citibank and received a letter from them dated XX/XX/2020 stating my XXXX  would mature on XX/XX/2020 and that it would automatically renew for the same term unless I request a change. So, to this effect, I called Citibank on XX/XX/2020 and spoke with XXXX ( reference number XXXX ). I told her I received the letter and wanted to make sure the XXXX does not renew. She at some point said she was having difficulty hearing me but then seemed like she understood the reason for my call. She explained that if I did not wish for the XXXX to renew they could mail me a check and specified the amount that would be mailed to me ( which I later learned was not even the 2.5 % interest amount which I had originally agreed to ). At the end of the phone conversation, she told me to allow 5-7 business days for me to receive the check at which point I actually clarified and said, "" you mean 5-7 days AFTER the maturity date '' to which she clearly replied "" yes ''. At no point did I say I wanted to terminate the XXXX prior to the maturity date. I was very clear as to the intent of my call which was simply to make sure that the XXXX did not automatically renew. 

On XX/XX/2020, I received a check in the mail ( in amount which was actually {$550.00} less that the amount XXXX had told me ) from Citibank. It was then that I realized what she had done. She had quoted me the value of my XXXX  on the day of my call ( before maturity ) and taken it upon herself to close the account prior to maturity rather than waiting for the XXXX to mature and then send the check which is what I understood she was going to do. I called Citibank that same evening and discussed the issue with the supervisor ( XXXX ) who told me she would file my complaint with XXXX and send her an email to see if XXXX or her manager could fix the problem since XXXX, the supervisor, was unable to do so. I inquired with XXXX and she confirmed that Citibank would be able to listen to the pre-recorded phone call to verify my complaint using the reference number above. She also recommended that I call at XXXX the next morning and file a "" Presidential complaint '' with the Executive Response Unit. I tried to do this the following morning but when I called Citibank and spoke with XXXX, the daytime supervisor, she said that office could not be contacted due to COVID-19 and that I would just have to wait for them to call me directly since XXXX had put in a request for them to contact me the prior evening ( which she had not told me she would do. XXXX assured me the Executive Response Unit would call me the same day since XXXX had put in the request but I received no such call. 

I called my local branch in XXXX, XXXX  on XX/XX/2020 and spoke with XXXX, the assistant manager, and was told the branch would be unable to assist me since the XXXX was closed by the customer service representative over the phone. I was told to call them back to try to resolve the problem. 

I have since called several more times ( with hold times over an hour and at times even being hung up on before being able to speak to any representative ) but I have been unsuccessful in my attempts to get the full amount which I am due for the 1 year XXXX  that I did not authorize to be closed prior to the termination date. In fact, I have not cashed the check yet from Citibank because theoretically the funds should have remained in the XXXX  until XX/XX/2020 and I fully intended to keep the funds there until maturity. I even suggested to Citibank to put a stop check in effect and "" reopen '' the XXXX since I did not authorize it to be closed but they told me that would not be possible.

I called Home Depot backnto find out why I am responsible and they stated that the packages were delivered to my address. I told them the tracking numbers clearly show that the address was updated by the sender ( home depot ) to a different address as shown on the tracking. The tracking does not show the address, just a note stating the address was updated. They opened another dispute, just to close it again stating that packages were sent to me. I do not have these packages, I never ordered these products and home depot not ups will not tell me the address that the packages were sent to.

And my letter from home depot does not show the amount owed, it only has the reason for why they believe I owe for the fraudulent charges.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",TX,774XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/07/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3524374
03/18/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XX/XX/2020 I attempted to open a checking account with Citibank, i was told i would hear something in a few days, as it was an online account opening. I never heard anything. Several days later, checks for a checking account arrived at my home, followed by a Debit card and PIN number. I activated the card and deposited money, by transferring money from my savings account at Citibank. I then began using the card and the account for ACH bill pay services. on or about XXXX toth i went to login to online banking, and was unable to do so. thinking it was just a temporary glitch i tried later in the day, it still didnt work, and was advised to register my card and my PIN again, i tried unsuccessfully. I tried calling the bank. they procedded to tell my i did not have a card linked to my checking account, however they wwere able to see transactions i had made that day on my debit card. they issued a new debit card. the previous evening I had written check XXXX and XXXX, both in the amount of {$370.00} when my balance was, and continues to be {$1300.00}, at the time of this complaint. 
on XX/XX/XXXX, i received an email saying that there were returned checks on my account, i accessed online banking, and saw that my account balance had not changed, and there was no notice or record of either check being presented or returned. I initiated an online chat session, while simultaneously trying to call the bank. I spoke to a representative named XXXX, who assured me nothing had been returned, and all the checks would post to my account on XXXX stated nothing to worry about. i was on hold for over an hour, and nobody picked up the phone Later in the day i received notice from one of the parties I wrote a check to, that the check was not honored. 
I called back to Citibank, again was on hold for 48 minutes, and finally ended the call. 
Every time i call the bank or chat with a representative, i get a different story, and am forced to jump through hoops, all the while they have my funds, are not honoring checks, costing me returned check fees, embarrassment, and frustration not to mention hours trying to access my funds, or get answers. 
i have spoke to numerous people, all give different answers and explanations, yet i am stuck with fees, lost opportunity, lost time and aggravation. this is the worst experience i have ever had with a financial institution..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MN,554XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/18/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3570413

03/20/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,"I opened a Citibank Priority account in XXXX in US through their website. Immediately after I opened my account, I had to travel to XXXX for work. I had accessed my account couple of times and things were fine. 

Recently I found that my account was locked, I called the Citi bank US personal banking customer care to unlock my account. Due to the corona issue, I generally need to wait for about 10-15 minutes before I can speak to the customer care agent. 
The representative asks me a couple of questions ( SSN, address, account balance, account opening date, account time, all the account holders name, etc ) for which I reply. Then they ask me for the account number or the debit card. I don't have either of them, since I had traveled to XXXX before I could get my Debit card of my first statement. 

They tell me that there are only the following ways in which I can get my account unlocked : 1. Come to any Citi bank in US and show my identity - like passport or Driving license. This is not possible now, because of the corona issue going on now.

2. Get access to Debit Card or statement - These are currently stuck in my mail box in USA and I'm here in XXXX. I cant travel now to get the mails. 
3. One of the agent told me that I could try to get myself verified with the Local Citi Bank ( XXXX branch ) and ask them to send an email, but when I checked with them, they stated that they would not do it. 

I call the customer care to explain my situation and that the options provided to me are not viable at this time, but they don't see to care. I tried asking them to provide me an email address or get me transferred to a higher officer who could help, but they are unresponsive and cut the call.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NJ,076XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/20/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3574237
02/15/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"This is regarding dispute numbers XXXX and XXXX. The purchases were from Home Depot. 

Dispute XXXX was originally for {$160.00} and {$82.00} was disputed. It doesnt list the dispute date on my dispute history but does list when it was resolved in my favor which was XX/XX/2019. Citibank issued me a credit, then a conditional credit, then a permanent credit with no additional documentation required. The dispute was over XXXX seed that failed to properly germinate and the store refused to take the item back. Despite honoring the dispute in my favor, Citibank also paid the merchant, because they stated it was a valid purchase and it did not meet their return policy even though the webpage for XXXX seed contradicts their store return policy. The manager at the Home Depot states Citibank originally approved my dispute and Home Depot appealed it, so they were eventually paid. At no time did Citibank ask me for supporting documentation for my side of the story. I would have happily provided them with the website information or I would have taken it up with Home Depots home office through the XXXX. 

Dispute XXXX was originally for {$10.00} on XX/XX/2019. The item was disputed on XX/XX/2019 for {$10.00}. Citibank issued me a credit, then a conditional credit, then a permanent credit with no additional documentation required. The history shows resolved on XX/XX/2019. The dispute was over two bags of lime : one bag was damaged by water and the other bag was torn and leaked all over my car. I called the store to complain when I arrived home and discovered the problem. I returned the item, but they failed to properly process the return to my credit card. Despite honoring the dispute in my favor, Citibank also paid the merchant, because they stated the item was never returned. XXXX in the executive office at Citibank stated the lime bags were not damaged, the lime did not leak in my car, and I did not try to call the store. The manager of the Home Depot states they would never make these allegations, so XXXX was just making non-objective and accusatory accusations. Citibank records calls for quality assurance, so they will have a recorded copy of the phone call. I am asking that the CFPB ask for a copy of the recorded conversation. The only paperwork according to the store manager that is seen during the dispute process is what their home office sends them ; a signed receipt and the reason for the dispute. Then, they validate whether they believe it is a valid charge. At no time did Citibank ask me for supporting documentation for my side of the story. I would have happily provided them with what they needed to resolve the dispute or I would have taken it up with Home Depots home office through the XXXX in order to resolve it on my own. Obviously, well outside of the 60-90 day dispute period, I would not still have possession of the receipt. I believed Citibank resolved it in my favor, believing the store supported the claim that the item was returned. 

I have been working with a rep through the XXXX ; they have offered to refund the seed and the lime based on the documentation I provided to the store. They are refunding it to my Citibank account. Despite acknowledgement that the website is indeed wrong and that the lime should have been properly refunded ( e-mail correspondence ), they required me to sign an accommodation agreement before they would refund the amounts to my credit card. This includes waiving the right to litigate for how this was transacted. While part of this is on Home Depot, Citibank clearly had an obligation to investigate this properly and to ask me for supporting documentation. Asking me for these documents would have avoided this entire problem. I wouldnt have needed to sign an agreement under duress just to prove to Citibank that the refunds/disputes should have been properly handled. Obviously, taking a gift certificate from Home Depot would have been of no use. 

I am also asking that Citibank send me the full dispute history on these disputes including the merchants response. I have been e-mailing billing disputes about these charges since the XX/XX/XXXX, but I dont think I have previously requested these documents. 

I am attaching the following documents for the CFPBs records : The XXXX Home Depot PDF file, an e-mail conversation history with the Home Depots rep, copies of e-mails to billing disputes, copies of the dispute summary, and dispute letter showing one of the credits was permanent.

The offer was for a {$500.00} bonus based on the following : "" Eligible customers must enroll in the "" $ XXXX {$500.00} Checking and Savings Offer '' promotion. Open a new qualifying Checking AND Savings Accounts. To get the {$500.00} bonus, customer must make a deposit of {$15000.00} XXXX multiple deposits allowed XXXX within 30 days of account opening.

'' "" You will receive your cash bonus within 90 days after you complete the required activities. '' I successfully met the requirements, and this was verified by Citibank on several occasions : one where I called several months ago, one via chat in XXXX, and one today via phone. The first call said the {$500.00} bonus would be posted by XX/XX/XXXX at the latest. That did not happen. When I then chatted with Citibank via the website chat feature, they said they marked my account and I should receive the bonus but if I do not I would have to call. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, when I called, they said they would fill out another dispute form, but because there is no "" promo code '' for the dispute form, both the call agent and I are skeptical the dispute form will result in success.

01/05/20,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Banking errors,"In XXXX of 2019 Citibank offered to open a new checking account, which allowed to earn XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX bonus miles after meeting certain conditions, specifically by depositing {$15000.00} and keeping them for at least 60 days ( see the attached ). As I found out later the Citi program internal code was XXXX. 
I stopped by two different local branches, but nobody had any idea about this program and offer, and refused to open an account. After multiple attempts and calls to Citi, I finally opened online an account on XX/XX/2019 and deposited {$15000.00}. Per Citis request I also submitted a Form W-9. My full {$15000.00} deposit is still with Citi. 
After 60 days of my account opening, I started calling to your customer services department ( I have a record of all my calls and hopefully you too ) in order to find out when the promised miles would be posted on my XXXX XXXX account. Unfortunately, every time I had to explain to a representative the program that nobody was familiar with, but the response has been the same : I am eligible for the bonus miles, and should receive them soon, but it could take up to 90 days after initial 60 days. 
Finally, this due date had passed, but the miles have not been posted. On XX/XX/ 2019 I called again and talked with a customer support supervisor. He told me that he could not figure out what the situation with the bonus miles was and opened an internal inquiry # XXXX. He also stated that the investigation would take another 5-7 business days. 
Yesterday I talked with another supervisor. She told me that she could not find the initial trouble-ticket and opened a new one XXXX. However, she told me that it would take another 20 business days to investigate. 
Such situation is extremely frustrating to me, and I perceive it is a deceiving practice if not to say a fraud. I have spent many hours on fruitless discussions with clueless Citi representatives without any result. Meantime, Citi is using my money basically for free without any interest. 
Based on the above I am demanding : 1. Immediately post XXXX bonus miles on my XXXX account ; 2.  Get an explanation how the financial institution as Citibank could treat such terribly its customers, and what will be done to fix this problem. 
I believe I am not the only customer of Citibank who deal with this problem. Therefore, I hope that the Customer Financial Protection Bureau will look at this situation in order to avoid it in the future and protect many of us.

I then immediately transferred an amount sufficient to cover the value of the check from my savings account to my checking account and wrote a new check. The new check was honored.

01/21/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"Citibank closed my Citi Diamond Preferred credit card and did not violate the terms of the agreement. My account was closed in error but its proven almost impossible to speak with someone that can listen to the facts and events. The people that made the decision will not talk to me on the phone. Citi has changed the story on why the account was closed. Originally Citi said I had made 3 NSF payments over the life of the account. Not true. I sent Citi a 14 page fax and proved that was not the case. Afterwards Citi issued a new letter and said the account was closed due to 1 NSF payment in the past 6 months. Below I provide the details of the 1 error I made which should never have resulted in the closure of my account. 

FYI - I have a case pending with the "" Citi Executive Response Team '' to reopen my account. I assume it will be denied. This case has been open for 2 weeks and my case manager is now out of office until XX/XX/XXXX. When I opened the case she agreed my account should have never been closed and I am the ideal customer Citi wants to attract. But they are treating me like I am bankrupt and don't pay my bills. 

FYI - I have a 2nd Citi card with a {$20000.00} limit and {$0.00} balance. That account remains open. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Citibank closed my Citi Diamond Preferred credit card without notice. I am the ideal Citi customer, spending over {$10000.00} annually on this card and paying it off. This card had a {$28000.00} limit. I had never paid it late. I have a XXXX FICO score ( at the time ). I make over {$250000.00} a year and I have money in the bank. I have called citi 15 times at least. I have submitted two requests to reopen my account. Both requests were denied, a different reason for account closure was given with each denial. These reopen requests go to the card services department. Customers can not speak to this department. Customer can only speak to customer service. Customer service submits a request to reopen, it goes to card services. You have to call back in to customer service to find out what the answer was. My experience of calling and trying to get help has been terrible. Nobody would listen to what I was saying. Eventually I ended up sending 14 pages of documentation on XXXX XXXX  XXXX. I spent {$25.00} at XXXX XXXX to send this fax. I was traveling for the holidays and did not have access to a fax machine. 

Why was my account closed - Citi says I have made XXXX NSF payment in the past 6 months. On XX/XX/XXXX I decided to make a second payment to my citi card for the month of XX/XX/XXXX. Again, this was a secondary payment. My XX/XX/XXXX payment was made and posted on time. I logged into the citi app on XX/XX/XXXX to make the additional payment to principal of {$240.00}. Generally I use my XXXXXX/XX/XXXX checking account which is already linked to Citi for payments. But on XX/XX/XXXX madethe mistake ( This is where I messed up ) of deciding to use my XXXX checking account. This was the first time I had used XXXX to pay Citi. I have two XXXX accounts. XXXX account # XXXX has over {$43000.00} in cash at all times. There is no debit card tied to this account. XXXX account # 2 has a debit card tied to it and runs a low balance and Imove funds into it if and when needed from the {$43000.00} account. Basically if I want to use the XXXX debit card XXXX transfer money to that account. When I added XXXX as a payment source I made the mistake of adding XXXX account # 2 with low funds. I meant to add XXXX account # 1 with {$43000.00}. I made the payment of {$240.00} and didn't think about it again. On XX/XX/XXXX Citi emailed me that my payment was rejected for NSF. I saw this email on XX/XX/XXXX and logged in right away to fix that issue but found my Citi Diamond preferred account was closed. I called customer service around XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to start the process to reopen my account. I explained the mistake I had made. On XX/XX/XXXX I called back and found the request to reopen had been rejected. 

Citi claimed I had violated terms and made XXXX NFS payments over the life of the account. Citi claimed I made two payments for {$25.00} XXXX Not true ) on XX/XX/XXXX and both were rejected for "" Account Frozen ''. And the 3rd payment of course was XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX. I sent Citi a 14 page fax on XX/XX/XXXX to prove I did not have 3 NFS. This was my XXXX request to reopen the account. I get into more of that detail below. 



XX/XX/XXXX - My XXXX Business Checking account ending in XXXX was breached online. Someone accessed my account online and transferred out {$5000.00}. I caught the fraud, changed my XXXX password and stopped it before more money could be transferred. XXXX forced me to open a new checking account ( I had {$48000.00} in the account that was breached ( XXXX ). I had no choice here and had to open the new checking account. XXXX did a partial freeze on account XXXX but said I could still use it. There was {$35.00} remaining in account XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I paid Citi {$25.00} XXXX there was {$35.00} in the account XXXX ). There was only one payment attempt. Citi rejected his payment for "" Account frozen ''. So Ipaid from another account and never thought anything about it. 
It seems that Citi counted this 1 payment as 2 payments. In my 14 page fax I showed citi chase statements that only one payment was made. I sent Citi the fraud info, documents where XXXX approved my fraud claim, documents where chase forced me to open a new account, documents where I had {$35.00} in account XXXX but the {$25.00} payment to Citi as rejected. In the end Citi should have removed the 1 NFS from XX/XX/XXXX from my account record. Instead of removing it, they counted it twice! When I made the 2nd request to reopen the account on XX/XX/XXXX, in the 14 pages I faxed, I explained all of this. Citi denied the request to reopen. But theychanged the reason why. Now they claim I had made 1 NFS in the past 6 months. They are now referring only to the XX/XX/XXXX payment from XXXX. 

In short, I made one NFS payment because I added the wrong bank account for my extra payment in XX/XX/XXXX. It was a simple mistake. Citi closed my account which dropped my credit score. I lost {$28000.00} in available credit. I am a great customer, I spend a lot of money, always pay on time, pay off the full balance annually, and I have many cards with high limits. I just want my account reopened as I didn't do anything wrong. Hopefully the Citi Exec response team will agree and reopen it. Citi is treating me like I am not a qualified customer.

It is under my Fsthers name, but I am an authorized user and use the card and make all the payments. 
I am a small business owner trying to make it through this pandemic. I am trying to find new ways to sell new products and there are some things I needed to use my credit card for as opposed to cash or check. Or at least it would have been more expedient. So, without having much cash on hand these days, I chose to pay down my citi card {$6000.00} in order to free up room to use it. 
The {$6000.00} payment was processed on XX/XX/XXXX, and then on XX/XX/XXXX Citi decreased my credit limit by {$6000.00} ... this has put me and my business in serious jeopardy. I dont have {$6000.00} to be pretty much wasted like that in a time like this. I would have just made the minimum payment if I knew this was going to happen. 
I have made all my payments on time and there are no issues with the credit bureaus as they claimed. There doesnt seem to be any valid reason for this move that they made other than to limit their exposure to other customers who arent paying their bill. 
They have me 10 different excuses why this happened, none of which made any sense. It seems awfully coincidental to me that I make a {$6000.00} payment, then 2 days later I get a email claiming some sudden issue with the credit bureau and they instantly lower my limit by that exact same amount of {$6000.00}??? 
We called the credit bureau as well, no issues. They said they didnt see why this would happen, there is nothing on their end that would explain this. 
This {$6000.00} is A TON of money for me and my business in these times. The consequences of them doing this to me could be catastrophic. I chose to make this kind of payment in good faith, and never thought I would be taken advantage of on this way, especially during these difficult times.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",IL,605XX,None,Consent provided,Web,05/21/20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3655081

02/25/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"Citibank is intentionally delaying posting of payments received when account is in interest-earning mode. My experience has been that payments are posted quickly when the account is earning them no interest. I'm accustomed to payments appearing on my citibank account within about four days of mailing them, when account is not earning interest.

But when I do not make full payment and account begins earning interest for Citibank, payments suddenly start taking up to two weeks to post. When they are posted, they are sometimes backdated a day or two. That leads me to believe they're not posting until payment clears my bank, which is a separate issue. But even backdated a day or two, they are still posted to my account quite tardily. 

Furthermore, Citibank has many locations where they can process my payments, yet they force me to send them across the country to XXXX, AZ. Do California customers mail their payments to Citibank 's NJ location? 

All of this adds up to Citibank manipulating customers to get them to pay interest which Citibank is not rightfully owed.

We want everything in writing and to ensure these folks are even legit as their behavior is extremely unproffesional for a recovery company and this debt is far outside of the SOL. This is not the first time I have been contacted for my ex-wife 's debts as she claimed bankruptcy in XXXX. They heard my wife who was reminding me of our rights in the background and asked who is that in the background spouting off? They have called her personally multiple times in the past so she got on the phone and explained again our rights for verification of debt and contact info for cease and desist and he was extremely disrepectufl when she said as a consumer advocate we know you can not behave this way. The consumer has rights and should be advised of them when debt collection is being rendered. He said he will see us in court and we don't need anymore information than that.

A provisional credit was given for {$1700.00}, I called and stated that the amount wasn't correct, another credit was issued for {$1700.00}.

What Citi did was instead reversing the {$1700.00} credit, they rebilled me {$1200.00} which to means they were crediting the {$490.00} as requested, that is the difference between the provisional credit of {$1700.00} and {$1200.00}.

He rented a sander, bought tools, and parts for his own use over this time period totaling approximately XXXX dollars. During this time not once did Citibank call me to alert me of erratic consumer behavior based on any of my past years. This contractor thief made about 55 purchases in one 30 day period and was shopping in Home Depot stores far from my home.

01/09/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"Hi, I was doing basement project at my home and opened Home Depot Consumer credit card through citibank in XX/XX/XXXX. I was offered 24 months XXXX % promotional price for any purchase made over {$5000.00}. Therefore, I bought almost $ XXXX worth of stuff from home depot on HD consumer card. However, I kept making my minimum payment plus additional amount to pay off my balance well within 24 months before the promotion expires. 
I started another project in XX/XX/XXXX and again purchased almost {$13000.00} worth of stuff on HD consumer card and was offered the same 24 months XXXX % financing. I paid off {$13000.00} + monthly payments by XX/XX/XXXX to avoid any interest charge on my outstanding promotional balance. 
Then I started another project again in XX/XX/XXXX and purchased {$7500.00} worth of stuff on HD consumer card and was again offered 24 months XXXX % financing. I again paid off that {$7500.00} + monthly payments by XX/XX/XXXX to avoid any interest change on my outstanding promotional balance. 
All this time, I also kept making smaller purchases for my smaller project. As of XX/XX/XXXX, my balance was {$5400.00} due to all smaller purchased. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I was charged {$1400.00} interest fee for some outstanding balance from XX/XX/XXXX. Now that I have been making payments to pay off my outstanding promotional balance, why have I been charged interest for {$1400.00}? When I was making payment they should be applied towards the previous outstanding promotional balance and not on the recent purchases? This seems be to fraud / cheat to intentionally defer your payments so there is always a balance from promotional outstanding balance so citibank can charge interest to the consumer. 
Logically the incoming payment must be applied towards your previous outstanding balance and not towards the recent purchases. What if there was no promotional balance? Citibank would have applied the payments towards that non promotional previous outstanding balance first? This is serious matter making consumer prey to these fraud practice by the bank. 

I would like the interest charged to be reversed.

I received an e-mail saying that CITI needs a copy of my utility bill and a copy of my social security card to verify my information, so I immediately faxed copies of my social security card and paystub to CITI on the same day ( XX/XX/XXXX ). One week later ( ~XX/XX/XXXX ) and two weeks later ( ~XX/XX/XXXX ), I called CITI customer service since there is no update. CITI customer service confirmed that they have received my documents via fax and told me that they will try to expedite the verification process so that I will be able to access to my account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I finally received an e-mail saying that CITI bank finally verified my information and will send me a debit card ( I did not have any access to my account since I have not received a debit card on my account ). At this point, because of CITI 's delay of verification process of my information, the {$700.00} bonus was voided because the promotion requires me to deposit {$50000.00} within 30 days of the opening of my accounts. I called CITI customer service about my concern, and CITI customer service told me to go ahead to deposit {$50000.00} into my accounts and call back to file a dispute on XX/XX/XXXX for investigation of the delay of verification process, and if CITI recognizes that the delay was caused by CITI 's fault, {$700.00} bonus will be paid to me. So, I deposited {$50000.00} into my Savings and Checking accounts immediately after receiving my debit card and left my money in my accounts untouched until today ( more than 120 days ). 

I called CITI customer service and explained my situation to file disputes on XX/XX/XXXX ( 1st dispute ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( 2nd dispute ). On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I received letters saying "" my account does not qualify for the promotion because the required amount of deposit was not made within the stated timeframe '' for the both disputes.

06/02/20,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XX/XX/XXXX I checked my account balance information at Citibank and much to my horror realized {$180000.00} had fraudulently and without authorization been withdrawn from my savings account and {$60000.00} had been fraudulently and without authorization been withdrawn from my money market account. I immediately informed Citibank of the the withdrawls and was informed by their fraud department the funds had been removed by a company named XXXX XXXX ( which is a XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX ) in a series of withdrawls ranging from {$10000.00} to {$30000.00}. I informed Citibank that I had never heard of XXXX XXXX much less had any commercial dealings with them nor had I ever given XXXX XXXX or any other person account information for my savings account or money market account nor ever authorized anyone to make any withdrawls from such accounts. I was told by Citibank not to alert the authorities about this crime as they would handle it as part of their investigation. On XX/XX/XXXX, {$30000.00} was returned to my money market account. On XX/XX/XXXX the remaining {$30000.00} was returned to my money market account ( see attachments ), leaving the {$180000.00} stolen from the savings account outstanding. I was told to be patient regarding the savings account. Over the next couple of months I heard nothing further from Citibank. Finally on or about XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with Citibank and was told that the investigation had been concluded and they could not return the funds because I had authorized the withdrawls. This was completely false because as mentioned above, I had never dealt with XXXX XXXX, had never given anyone my savings account information or authorized anyone to make a withdrawl from such account, had never purchased any good or service remotely close to {$240000.00}. Additionally, the {$60000.00} was restored to my account because it was fraudlenty removed and the underlying facts were exactly the same for the savings account withdrawls. I was told that I was entitled by law to obtain a copy of Citibank 's investigation file, which I did verbally and in writing ( see attached letter ). It was particularly important that we obtain a copy of the file because Citibank was claiming we authorized withdrawls when we had not and because in subsequent correspondence from Citibank we learned that they had been investigating a money market account when the account in question was a savings account. We have received nothing in response. We subsequently received written letters from Citibank referencing a new investigation into our money market account made at our request ( we did not make such request ), referencing a money market account with an account number that we don't have, telling me the results of the investigation are ; and then leaving a blank and then asking me to input the case summary as if I was an employee of Citibank with access to their computer database. I made several calls to Citibank, to their customer service department, to their fraud department and to our relationship manager and was promised on multiple occasions that a copy of the file would be sent and that someone would get to the bottom of why such incomprehensible letters were sent to us.

When I contacted Citibank, the representative stated it was probably a glitch in the system and did not suggest that I blocked the account however opened a case. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, another ACH transfer was made for {$21000.00} to a XXXX credit card. At this point, the representative suggested that I placed a block on my account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Citibank credited me {$6600.00} and on XX/XX/XXXX credited me {$21000.00}. Per the letter sent, "" We have concluded our research and are pleased to inform you that your request for reimbursement has been honored '' On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from Citibank Fraud department who informed me that my online banking information has been compromised so they will take action to issue me a new debit card. When I inquired whether my account will need to be closed they said NO. 

Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX when I realized my account has been blocked. Their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX states "" your accounts are now restricted from any debits and certain credits and will be closed within sixty days from the date of this letter ... If there are any funds that belong to you at the time of closure, Citibank will issue you an official check for that balance ... you may visit your local branch or contact us at the number below to determine if you're entitled to the funds sooner than the expected account closure date '' Since then I have called Citibank fraud department multiple times and went to the local branch ( 2 days after the date of the letter ) to attempt to close my account and receive my check but was met with the same brick wall- "" this is our policy, there is nothing you can do to access your money or close your account until the investigation is over '' As it stands I have over $ 55K sitting in my accounts that can not be accessed for "" up to 60 days ''. I just got my offer accepted for a home and I need the funds ASAP. I can not wait up to 60 days to receive my checks. It is absolutely unacceptable that I have no access to my money for an extended period of time. 

See Regulation E below. Citibank has given me my provisional credit within a week of filing the claim however they turn around and block my entire account and are preventing me from accessing it for up to 60 days. From where I stand as the consumer, if this is a loophole that the banks can perform, how am I really protected as a consumer by this regulation that ensures I have timely access to my funds in the case of a fraud investigation? 




Regulation E 1005.11 Procedures for resolving errors, cited below : ( 1 ) Ten-day period. A financial institution shall investigate promptly and, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph ( c ), shall determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days of receiving a notice of error.

An institution need not provisionally credit the consumer 's account if : ( A ) The institution requires but does not receive written confirmation within 10 business days of an oral notice of error ; or ( B ) The alleged error involves an account that is subject to Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ( Securities Credit by Brokers and Dealers, 12 CFR part 220 ) ; ( ii ) Informs the consumer, within two business days after the provisional crediting, of the amount and date of the provisional crediting and gives the consumer full use of the funds during the investigation ;",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,921XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/10/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3560952

It took some time but they eventually found it. There was a lot of copies of conversations back and forth between XXXX via email and XXXX via emails. XXXX confirmed that they did not charge me and XXXX advised that my flight was booked through a third party ( XXXX ) not through me directly and they did not charge me either. On my credit card statement XXXX XXXX charge for the seat change was from XXXX XXXX. The other charge was from ( my ticket number ) XXXX XXXX California for the {$1300.00}. I questioned XXXX if they had an office in XXXX XXXX, CA and they advised me that they did not. I told Citibank dispute department many times and they said that had nothing to do with it. I have been asking Citibank to show me how the charges came into there location to see the differences between the two charges and I have yet to see any of this paperwork. XXXX has sent them all the information showing that I did take that flight that day and I am not saying I didn't. I agree that I have and that I paid for that ticket through XXXX. I provided the paperwork I received from XXXX of my final documents showing my ticket numbers and my seat change number. 
I have still been calling Citibank asking for document proof and they just keep telling me they are unable to get the merchant to issue credit for these charges. I keep telling them I would like to see how these charges came to them with no response to that request. I have told every person I have talked to at Citibank I have lost respect and confidence in their credit card because they are definitely not looking out for my interest. 
I would appreciate anything you could do for me at this time. I have been getting charged interest on this money now and have been paying a little off of it at a time. 
I am attaching the last big correspondence I have sent them that contains all the pertinent information. They also have the first big batch of emails correspondence I sent to them from XXXX and XXXX.

I called the phone number provided, XXXX that was answered by a female person named "" XXXX '' who stated that could provide assistance upon verification of my identity. "" XXXX '' stated that it would be necessary to verify my identity by means of a XXXX XXXX  transaction. I questioned this transaction and she assured me that there would not be any charges made to me as a result of this process. She walked me through through the transaction setting that I needed to use the "" XXXX identification code of XXXX '' in the transaction to complete the identification process. I asked her again if any charges would be made to me and she stated that this was a "" dummy '' transaction and "" no charges would be made. '' I began to explain the technical problems I was having and she could not understand what I was saying. I heard loud background noise and "" XXXX '' said I should call her back on her direct line of "" XXXX. '' I became suspicious and after hanging up tried to call her back, however, there was not answer at that number. 

At this point I felt that the conversation with "" XXXX '' might not be legitimate and I called the CITI customer service at "" XXXX '' to report a possible fraud. I was that two transactions had posted XXXX account in the the amount of {$510.00}. I promptly disputed this and was told to wait until the CITI statement period to further continue the dispute. I followed up with two more calls to CITIto make sure that the dispute had been filed. CITI advised me to close the credit card used for the transaction and they would issue a replacement.

I called to ask about hardship assistance and was enrolled in a hardship program that closed my account but would help me pay off the card. 

I asked numerous times if I would be reported as delinquent by Citi Bank after enrolling in this program. I was told that I would not be reported as delinquent and that my balance would now only have a rate of 0 % and a 60-month payment plan. The only thing that would be reported to the credit bureaus as long as I made my monthly payments on time while in the program is that the account was closed. 

A month later I get a report that Citi Bank has been reporting me every month since the program began as deliquent due to a past due payment when I enrolled. I was told this would be rolled into the balance due and the program, instead it remained as separate delinquency and each of my payments to the program went towards it making every payment late. 

I filed a complaint and the call was reviewed and I was told that the representative did provide inaccurate information to me but there was nothing the woman I spoke to could do to remove the late reports I needed to submit a dispute to another department and was given an address despite Citi Bank confirming they were in the wrong.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email message from AAdvantage Corporate Security terminating my account. The message accuses me ( incorrectly ) of multiple violations of the General AAdvantage Program Terms and Conditions. On XX/XX/XXXX, I responded to corporate security to request further clarification of the specific violations XXXX XXXX alleges that I have violated. On XX/XX/XXXX, I replied again to this e-mail to request clarification. To date, these e-mails have gone unanswered. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I also e-mailed XXXX XXXX to request additional information and clarification of the alleged violations. This e-mail has also gone unanswered as of today. 

An official complaint with the Department of Transportation was also filed on XX/XX/XXXX. Receipt of this complaint was confirmed by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and a response from XXXX XXXX was received from XXXX XXXX, Customer Relations, on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX response to my complaint states the following as justification for termination of my account : A recent investigation has determined your involvement in multiple violations of the General AAdvantage Program Terms and Conditions, related to the accrual of ineligible AAdvantage miles and benefits. These actions specifically involve abuse of the AAdvantage Program through gaming behavior, used to circumvent the Citibank/AAdvantage card enrollment bonus eligibility restrictions, particularly that bonus miles are not available if you have received a new account bonus in the past 48 months. These restrictions are outlined in the Citi/AAdvantage   card promotion bonus terms and conditions, as well as at the top of each application page. 

The allegations against me and used as the basis for terminating my AAdvantage account are not correct. The 48-month language cited as justification for termination of my account was not added to the some of the terms of conditions until on or around XX/XX/XXXX. There were still various credit card offers that did not contain that 48-month language. At no time did I respond to, or utilize, any offers which contained this newly added provision. 

Further, the Citi eligibility restrictions referenced in the justification were not located on the credit card offer bonus terms and conditions or application page as claimed in Ms. XXXX e-mail.

However on XX/XX/XXXX, I received communication from Citibank that my case was resolved, with no other information. When I called Citibank, they informed me that he case was closed not in your favor, and they had not received any of the documents I sent. She said there was no information about why my claim was denied and told me that I should contact XXXX XXXX, as the case was closed and there was nothing she could do for me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX at XXXX XXXX, who is the manager of the identity theft unit at XXXX XXXX. She was the first helpful person in the long process and explained that Citibank seems to wrongly have classified my claims as ACH disputes, when in reality they are online billing disputes.

The merchant stated to me that they issued my refund, but I have not received the refund ( I received a "" conditional credit '' from Citi that can be reversed, but no actual refund from the merchant ). To the best of my knowledge, XX/XX/XXXX has not stated to Citi that the merchandise was returned to them, but I did provide Citi with that information, along with the tracking number as proof. In the weeks/months after that point, Citi 's deadline was pushed back several more times, first to XX/XX/XXXX, then to XX/XX/XXXX, then to XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by Citi via phone that the refund would post by early the following week and would be reflected in my next statement, however that was not the case ( again, I did still have the "" conditional credit '', but there was no final decision in the dispute, or a final refund posted to my account, as promised ). On XX/XX/XXXX I received my statement ( the one I was told would reflect the refund ) and when there was no mention of a refund, I contacted Citi via phone again. This time I was told it may take until XX/XX/XXXX to make a final decision, but definitely no longer than that. I told the Citi associate that I was getting frustrated with all the extended deadlines and would file a formal complaint against Citi with the XXXX XXXX XXXX if the refund was not made/finalized by XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the date on Citi 's website was pushed back yet again to XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX  complaint was filed via fax. I called Citi today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and the automated line told me that the credit was now permanent. Wanting confirmation since Citi 's website still listed the credit as conditional, I asked for an operator and was eventually connected to the disputes department. The Citi associate I spoke with claimed ( counter to the automated line ) that the credit was not yet permanent, as Citi had not heard from the merchant 's bank. I informed the Citi associate that the merchant told me ( via e-mail ) that they would not be in touch with Citi, and I also added that Citi stated on their site that they would give the merchant ( or merchant 's bank ) until XX/XX/XXXX to respond and that that date had already passed.

The information packet I received with the card indicated I was not eligible for the sign up bonus of XXXX points after spending {$4000.00} in 3 months because I either "" earned a new cardmember bonus or closed a Citi Rewards+, XXXX XXXX  Preferred, Premier, or Prestige in the past 24 months '' However, I keep very diligent records and see that the last XXXX  card I earned a signup bonus was a previous XXXX XXXX card which I opened on XX/XX/XXXX ( ending XXXX ), for which I received the bonus points in XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached XXXX  points history, and note that the name listed is XXXX XXXX because that is my maiden name ), which would mean the 24 months has since passed between then and my newest application. 

Of note, I have converted products from that Premier card ( which ended XXXX ) to a Preferred in XX/XX/XXXX, and then to a Rewards+ recently in XX/XX/XXXX, but I never closed any of those XXXX   cards. 

As such, I have neither earned a new cardmember bonus or closed a XXXX  product within the last 24 months and should be eligible for the bonus on this new XXXX  Premier card. 

When I called Citi to explain this issue, it came to my attention that the representative saw an apparent previous Citi Premier card opened on XX/XX/XXXX ( ending in XXXX ). This is a Citi Premier card opened by my HUSBAND, not by me. I believe that during my application for my Premier card ( ending XXXX ) that I accidentally put in my husband 's SSN rather than my own, and I had to call the application department to correct the application. However, it appears that this original mistake is what caused my new account to be flagged as ineligible for the sign up bonus, due to the original SSN linked to the application to be associated with a recently opened XXXX product. I assumed this would be a simple mistake to correct, and was told the situation would be explained to the "" back office '' and that I would receive a letter resolving the issue. However, I have since received a letter stating that I am still ineligible because I was requesting a "" new account offer [ be ] applied to [ my ] existing account, '' and that new offers are only available on new accounts. 

This completely misses the point that the original offer should have been applied to the new account but was erroneously not-applied due to a mistake on Citi 's part. I am not trying to apply a new-card bonus to an existing card ; I am trying to have a wrongfully refused new-card bonus properly credited to a new-card. 

I have since tried repeatedly calling in to explain the insanity of this response by Citi, but am unable to speak to a human and get hung up on by the computer system.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MN,559XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/16/20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3608942

On XX/XX/XXXX, my husband and I visited Citibank Magnificent Mile Branch ( Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, IL XXXX ) A banker, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( NMLS XXXX, phone : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, email : XXXX ), helped me open the Citi Bank Account Package account, including new checking and saving accounts, with the promotional XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX bonus miles offer. I also received the email from Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX, saying that I have successfully got enrolled in this offer. Please see the attached figure for the offer details. 

2. To get the offered bonus of XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX miles, the banker asked me to complete two required activities : ( 1 ) deposit at least {$1000.00} into checking account and at least {$14000.00} into saving account by XX/XX/XXXX ( 2 ) maintain the balance in the account for 60 consecutive calendar days following the date when the deposit was made. Then, the bonus will be deposited to my XXXX account within 90 calendar days from the date when I complete the above required activities. I could offer the document from the banker showing the required deposit if needed. 

3. Therefore, following the bank 's guidance : ( 1 ) on XX/XX/XXXX, I deposited {$2000.00} new money to my new checking account and {$14000.00} new money into my savings account. ( 2 ) The total balance of {$16.00}, 000 was maintained in my accounts from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, which is way over 60 days. As a result, I completed the required qualifying activities to be eligible for the offered bonus and should receive the bonus by XX/XX/XXXX. 

4. However, I did not receive the bonus by then. So I contacted the Citi Bank by phone twice in XX/XX/XXXX and the representative told me they would reward me the bonus miles by the middle of XX/XX/XXXX. But, the bonus did not come XX/XX/XXXX. 

5. Therefore, on XX/XX/XXXX, I visited the CitiBank at XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, IL XXXX ) and the banker told me I am eligible for the bonus and requested an investigation for me. The reference number of investigation XXXX. But, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received the investigation results in my online Citi account, saying that "" Unfortunately, your account does not qualify for this promotion because the required depositwas not maintained for the stated timeframe. '' 6. On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the CitiBank at XXXX again. Another banker who talked to us confirmed that I ameligible for the bonus and made another investigation request ( Reference number : XXXX ). She also got my XXXX XXXX account number to be deposited. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, the result was exactly the same as that XXXX. 

7. I definitely can not accept the results from Citibank and do believe should get the XXXX bonus miles, because : ( 1 ) I completely followed the guidance from the banker who opened new accounts for me and got me enrolled in this offer and completed all the required activities. I could offer the document from the banker showing the required deposit if needed. 
( 2 ) The offer enrollment confirmation email I received was saying that "" Make a deposit of {$15000.00} or more ( multiple deposits allowed ) in New-to-Citibank funds into 1 ) the new Eligible Checking Account and/or 2 ) the new Eligible Savings Account ''. I completed all the required activities.

04/13/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"This is my second time to contact the CFPB over a disputed charge with my Citibank credit card. The first time I made a complaint with CFPB, it was because for months, I was disputing a charge of of {$1800.00} while Citi was investigating a totally different and unrelated charge and maintaining that the unrelated charge was valid. I messaged Citibank repeatedly, and it was as if they were not even reading my messages. I would get back form-letter emails saying some other unrelated charge was valid. Only after contacting the CFPB and getting assistance, did Citibank finally even address the actual charge I was disputing. 

That being said, addressed might be the wrong word. Again, it's as if they do not even read the messages I write to them. Their replies never address or acknowledge anything I have written them about. 

As it stands, I am being charged {$1800.00}. This charge ended up on my credit card on XX/XX/2019 when I visited XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. Currently, Citibank claims the charge is valid because they have a "" signed receipt. '' Additionally, they tell me the the card was physically present for the charge. 

I am attaching a copy of the "" signed '' receipt provided to me by Citibank. The signature is not mine. It is an absolute forgery, just a bunch of squiggles at the top of the paper. Also, there are two sheets provided, and they seem to show different dates. This seems odd to me. I noted it too on the attached file. 

Citibank says that my card which has a chip on it was present for the charge. My best guess is that I was taken advantage of, perhaps by an employee or some person in on a scam, by running my actual card without my knowledge. I am certain that this is a scam of some sort by the fact that it is not my signature at the top of the receipt given to my by Citibank. 

I don't know what to do at this point. I have gone back and forth with Citibank for months, and their total incompetence at researching something wholly unrelated was only resolved after contacting CFPB. Now, Citi tells me the charge is valid and when I reply to Citi that the signature they provided is a forgery, they don't even acknowledge it. It is as if they are simply not even reading my messages. History has shown they surely do not. 

One more thing I find strange. As a matter of general practice, I checked my credit card online before leaving XXXX and saw no major pending purchases. It wasn't until I got home that I saw this charge appear, as if it were delayed on purpose.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,None,None,Consent provided,Web,04/13/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3604733

03/01/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"The following letter was written and sent on or behalf by our attorney after our personal letters and phone calls with Citibank received no response - at all - from Citibank. 

LEGAL MATTER TO BE DIRECTED TO CITIBANK LEGAL DEPARTMENT AND ITS GENERAL COUNSEL To the General Counsel of Citibank , N.A . : I have been retained by XXXX and XXXX XXXX, holders of Citibank credit cards, to file legal action against Citibank as a result of its failure now for more than three months to comply with its legal obligations regarding the fraudulent use of two of the XXXX credit cards despite the fact that they promptly notified the Bank of such fraud and fully cooperated with the Banks investigation of it. Nonetheless, the Bank has wrongfully refused to credit the XXXX for the fraudulent charges, as a result of which they have been forced to seek legal representation. 

Although they have brought all of the relevant underlying facts to the Banks attention on numerous occasion, I will do so once more so that there can be no doubt of the Banks unjustified recalcitrance in resolving the XXXX claims and its liability to them to credit all of the fraudulent charges made against their accounts. 

More particularly : CREDIT CARD ENDING IN XXXX : On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX  Citbank credit card number ending in XXXX was used fraudulently by someone who somehow obtained sufficient information regarding their card to make forty-three ( 43 ) separate individual fraudulent charges to XXXX without the knowledge or consent of the XXXX  and without possession of their card on which these charges were made. The XXXX  discovered these fraudulent charges on XX/XX/XXXX, and immediately notified the Bank of them, confirming that they had been fraudulently made. The Bank advised the XXXX  that it would promptly open an investigation and credit their account as to ALL of these fraudulent charges, assuring them that, under federal law and Citibank governances, they were not liable for them and that the Bank would absolutely refund the charges and any applicable interest. 

To date, three and half months later, Citibank still has not done so, but has reversed only five of the 43 fraudulent charges. During this time the Bank has made repeated unreasonable demands upon the XXXX in more than two dozen emails, claiming that, if the XXXX did not IMMEDIATELY respond to the Banks latest inquiries ( to which the XXXX  had already responded repeatedly ), it would close its file without reimbursement of the charges. Notwithstanding the unreasonableness of the Banks demands, the XXXX responded to them all, and, after each, was advised by the Banks representatives that all of the 43 fraudulent charges would be credited in their full amount. Now, three full billing cycles later, the XXXX  are still waiting for such credit.

On one of these calls with the Bank, the Banks representative advised the XXXX  that each of the 43 fraudulent charges ( all made in the same 24-hour period and all made to the same entity XXXX ) had to be reviewed individually, which was causing the delay, but certainly the review would be completed no later than XX/XX/XXXX. Despite the illegitimacy of the Banks professed excuse for delay, given that the same information applies to all 43 of the charges the Bank has still not credited the XXXX against these charges even after the expiration of its own unreasonable timeline. 
The total fraudulent charges made on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX under the card ending in XXXX were {$8000.00}, against which, to date, the Bank has credited only {$580.00}. If, as the Bank has acknowledged, the facts of its investigation support issuance of a credit for this sum ( not that it could have found otherwise ), how do these exact same facts not justify issuance of the remainder of the credit? 
CREDIT CARD ENDING IN XXXX : Because of the fraud on their credit card ending in XXXX, the XXXX  replaced that card with one ending in XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, no long after receiving their new card, it was stolen from XXXX XXXX purse while the XXXX  were visiting XXXX. Again, they immediately contacted Citibank to advise it of the theft, and also filed a complaint with the XXXX Police Department ( which report has already been turned over to the Bank several times ). This time, obviously, the thieves did have possession of the stolen card, and, despite the XXXX quick action in reporting the theft and cancelling the card, the thieves were able to make three ( 3 ) purchases at XXXX XXXX ( # XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX ( # XXXX ) totaling {$3100.00}. 

Despite the XXXX  prompt and complete compliance with all of their obligations regarding the reporting of this theft, and supplying all information available to them, the Bank has not, again for more than three months, credited them against these fraudulent charges. Even more outrageously, the Bank advised the XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX, that it was closing its investigating with a determination that {$2000.00} of these charges were not fraudulently incurred. On what basis did the Bank reach this conclusion? On the professed basis, according to their correspondence, that the XXXX supposedly advised the Bank that the credit card had remained in their possession, so that those charges for which the credit card was presented by the thieves had to be authorized!! Trying to give the Bank the benefit of the doubt regarding its totally fallacious reasoning, it appears that the Bank confused the first fraudulent charges ( regarding card XXXX ), for which the card never left the XXXX possession, with the second fraudulent charges ( regarding card XXXX ), for which the card was stolen and clearly in the thieves possession. The Bank needs to straighten out these two claims, which it apparently can not keep separated notwithstanding requiring the XXXX   again to respond to literally dozens of emails demanding information from them that they have already repeatedly provided. 

Is this how Citibank generally treats its cardholders? It will be interesting to discover that in litigation, should that become necessary, as, to date, it appears that it will be lest the Bank decide to honor its obligations to the XXXX  without further delay. If this is indeed how the Bank generally treats its cardholders in an effort to gain an improper financial benefit from them, the Bank may well find itself liable for punitive damages and for a class action suit. 

My instructions from the XXXX  are to begin drafting a complaint against the Bank, and to file it when ready without further notice to the Bank. It will take me a week to 10 days to do so. This window will represent the Banks final chance to avoid litigation by reversing all of these fraudulent charges against the XXXX credit cards. Absent notice to me that it has done so before the complaint is filed, the XXXX  will let the trier of fact provide its verdict, and doubt that any trier of fact will find any sympathy with the Banks unjustified, indeed outrageous, delaying tactics.

One final irony : I personally was the victim last week of credit card fraud in the amount of several thousand dollars. I reported it immediately and my bank handled the entire matter within two hours. That is how banks are supposed to treat their cardholders. It is up to Citibank to choose whether it wishes to learn that lesson the easy way or the hard way. 

Nothing in this letter is meant to waive, nor shall or may be construed as waiving, any rights held by the XXXX, all of which are expressly reserved.

On XX/XX/2019, our XXXX XXXX tech support package renewed for {$100.00}. 
Previously, we had been to Best Buy and were told all protection plans were converted to the Total Protection Plan. This covers all electronics in the house and a {$49.00} service fee for in-home visits. 

On XXXX, we called to make a service appointment for our XXXX  XXXX. We were told at this point the package had not converted and we owed another {$210.00}. They stated they would refund the {$100.00} to the account. As soon as the purchase came through the account, I disputed the prior charge on XXXX. 

I filed a prior XXXX  against Best Buy complaining about the price difference being snuck up on us at the last minute and asked Best Buy to stand behind what was told at the store level, giving a refund difference for this year. XXXX with the XXXX  's office refused. You can reference the XXXX  if you go to Best Buy 's headquarters. 

It appears Best Buy 's credit came through on the same day of my dispute, presumably after I filed it. Best Buy ran the refunds as two separate amounts : {$32.00} and {$76.00}. Best Buy finally stated it was refunded this way due to breaking it into XXXX and Tech support renewal. I confirmed this when looking at my Citibank letter as well. 

On XXXX, Best Buy issued a response to Citibank that stated they had no record of my cancellation even though the account was clearly refunded on XXXX. Citibank probably caught the way it was broken up by the breakdown amounts. Then, there is a note further down that doesnt display a date next to it where Best Buy acknowledges the refund. 

On XXXX, Citibank issued a letter to me stating the dispute was resolved.

03/30/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I am seeking a charge dispute approval in the amount of {$210.00} back to my card for an item that I successfully returned to Best Buys warehouse on XX/XX/2019. I have made more than a good faith effort to resolve this issue with both Best Buy and XXXX, but have not received any assistance or satisfaction. 

I placed my order on XX/XX/2019 and the item was delivered to my residence on XX/XX/2019. I no longer needed the item, because it was a gift for someone that I ended up purchasing in-store on XX/XX/2019, after being told that my original order would be cancelled. 

Once I received the item, I contacted Best Buy to get a return slip in order to ship the item back to the warehouse for a refund. Using the XXXX  shipping slip provided to me by a Best Buy agent, I first checked that the item was securely packaged and then shipped the item back at my local XXXX store on XX/XX/2019. The item arrived at the warehouse in XXXX, KY on XX/XX/2019. I then called Best Buy support on XX/XX/2019 and was told that Id receive a refund back to my card within 30 days, or the next billing cycle. 

When I saw that the refund had still not posted on XX/XX/XXXX, I called Best Buy again and was told that the box had arrived empty. After discussion with the agent, they agreed that XXXX or the warehouse had lost the item and I would be refunded within the next billing cycle. Again, after not receiving the refund, I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that they could not process a refund until I filed a damage claim with XXXX. So, I filed a damage claim that day, as seen in the XXXX tracking details. 

What ensued after I followed these instructions was phone tag and non-acceptance of responsibility. Best Buy told me to call XXXX, XXXX told me to call Best Buy, and so on and so forth. I spent more than 30 hours in the course of three months in customer support, from Best Buy and XXXX ( phone, chat, forum, email ). Best Buy gave me the same response each time that "" since the box arrived empty, we can not process a refund. '' XXXX gave me the same dead-end response that "" because Best Buy purchased the return label, they must contact us to resolve this. '' Best Buy ever contacted XXXX  or followed up with me regarding this case - a complete stalwart. Finally, after finding that neither side would provide assistance, I filed a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Best Buy responded to that complaint that they could not process a refund for a lost item. 

Next, I filed a consumer fraud complaint with the California Attorney General, which received the same response. The simple solution here would have been for Best Buy to provide me a refund for the item I clearly returned, and then communicate with XXXX regarding the damage claim in order to recoup any lost funds on their end. XXXX is Best Buys preferred provider, and since XXXX would not allow me to discuss the damage claim ( as technically I was not the shipper - Best Buy was ), I had no means to receive any assistance or guidance. 

My last attempt to resolve this issue was to dispute the charge on the card, as I had been promised by Best Buy twice that I would receive a refund and did not - and I had also made more than a good faith effort to resolve this case with Best Buy and XXXX. After submitting 30 pages of documentation to Best Buy CITI Card, I was told that they had closed the investigation, after being informed by Best Buy that "" they could not process a refund since the item returned empty. '' What was the point of submitting documentation if a real investigation would not be done? To me, it seems like Citi is not conducting objective investigations, but instead acting on behalf of Best Buy to deny chargebacks. 

I hope that Best Buy can see my utter frustration and disappointment in the behavior of their company, a company of which I have been a loyal customer for over 10 years. This issue has cost me an incredible amount of time and money, having to take hours and hours out of my workday in order to discuss and argue my position, for something that should have been resolved with one single call, as it is done with beloved companies like XXXX.

03/29/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"This is in regards to a ANNUAL FEE for a Citi Presitige Card that was recently increased from {$350.00} to {$490.00} without my consent, and where benefits were DECREASED ( removed most travel insurances and protections, and capped the 4th night free benefits, while increasing the fee ). 

The problem arose when CITI charged the annual fee and closed my account by mistake, and declined to re-open my account or reimburse the annual fee ( {$490.00} plus interests ). Citi has also declined to provide any of the benefits of the card, which heavily subsidize the annual fee XXXX {$250.00} travel travel credit, fourth night free, etc ). Despite my multiple attempts to resolve the issue on XX/XX/XXXX ( by phone twice, and XX/XX/XXXX by mail ), they have denied it. It is important to note that the entire balance in the closed account includes ONLY the annual fee and interest accrued due to CITI failing to remove the charge. I request that CITI remove this fee immediately before the account goes into collection and further damage to me and my credit report, at which point, CITI would have caused irreparable larger damage and be responsible for even larger loss. I also request that CFPB launches an investigation about CITI 's practices for fee increase and decrease on benefits and involuntary account closures by automated systems while keeping the fees. This should be prevented to happen for me and future customers. 

To be more specific with timeline, this is a credit card that I lost a few weeks ago and only use for small recurring payments that are auto-paid from my bank account. Once I saw a large balance in my account, on XX/XX/2020, I called customer service to discuss options on a {$490.00} annual fee that was billed in XX/XX/2020 ( which was increased this year from the {$350.00} that I paid last year, without my consent ). As you can imagine, when I saw the charge, I was surprised and wanted a resolution immediately, since this is a card that I do not use on a regular basis and I have used {$0.00} in benefits since the annual fee. With the old annual fee, I was ok getting the benefits in order to subsidize the expensive annual fee, however, the increase to {$490.00} seemed too much, so I wanted to clarity on the issue from customer service on new benefits and a resolution by speaking to them. 

I called late at night to customer service and while I was on the phone hoping to speak to the cancellation department, the AUTOMATED COMPUTER SYSTEM canceled my card BEFORE speaking to a human. A FEW MINUTES LATER after the automated system cancellation, and on the same phone call, I finally spoke to a human to correct the mistake, CITI 's customer service representative, and supervisor XXXX. I requested for the card be reinstated or get the annual fee reimbursed. He declined. 
A few minutes later, on XX/XX/2020, I called back your customer service representative XXXX on team 4, from the XXXX  department who declined to speak XXXX  to me and only spoke English to me. She advised me that XXXX was correct and regardless of whether my card was lost, I was unable to get a new card nor waived the annual fee. 

I further demanded that CITI waive the charge immediately on my letter to customer service from XX/XX/2020, and reserve the right to seek federal and state resolutions if this was not reimbursed. CITI declined to reimburse the illegally charged fee. 

I hope CFPB immediately intervene before further damage to my credit profile ( which is in the XXXX ) is done, and launch an investigation to CITI practices as outlines above.

In XX/XX/XXXX I called Citi and they confirmed that I have met all the requirements for the bonus. 

Shortly after this call, the next time I checked my account online, my savings account no longer exists. Multiple calls ( about 15 of them ) led me to the fraud department with conflicting messages but ultimately told me that the account is blocked and that I can only "" wit until the review is done '' for undetermined time. There is no supervisor or anyone with authority in any of the calls who can tell me the reason of the closure and a way to speed up the process because it is being processed by the "" back office '' with no possible contact, even by the fraud department. During those calls, no one offered me to do any type of verification process which I believe is the only way to verify and unblock the account. 

At this point, not only I have lost access of my own money which I desperately need, I also have lost the opportunity to earn a higher interest on the money, not to mention the time I spent on the phone with Citi. In addition, because I am in need of the fund, the situation forced me to take a new loan which costs me interest/transaction fee. 

Other customers with similar complaints can be found here ( and also in XXXX  website ) : XXXX : XXXX?

2. The second response referred me to their original letter and instructions, which I clearly followed until I reached a dead end. This shows that they did not read the original complaint.

04/29/20,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Problem with personal statement of dispute,"I have been attempting to resolve this issue for months now. A derogatory mark was placed on my credit report by Macys Inc due to a late payment of {$8.00} that was due by XX/XX/XXXX. Ultimately, a payment was submitted by me on XX/XX/XXXX of {$12.00} ( {$4.00} interest charges ). The dispute is not regarding the {$4.00} but the lack of proper notification by Macys that a payment was due. I should have received a notification via email on XX/XX/XXXX that a new statement was available, I never received this email. Macys claims that an email was sent and that a paper statement is sent, regardless of paperless statements, if a payment is late more than 30 days, I never received this letter, but Macys claims it was sent. I only found out about this late payment via a 3rd party, XXXX XXXX, and I immediately paid the balance due. The reason for delinquency has nothing to do with financial hardship as the amount is nominal, but due to a lack of proper notification from Macys towards its customer. Ive called the credit department that pertains to Macys and I have gotten nowhere, I escalated the issue to upper management, and nothing has been done other than not agreeing with my assessment of the situation. I wrote in 3 packages to separate address headquarters in XXXX to explain the situation, Ive written in to the corporate office multiple times through the web portal, and most recently I filed a complain via the XXXX XXXX   XXXX  and I only received a letter denying my request and Macys not willing to accept responsibility. Essentially, this is my word against Macys because they claim everything was sent and protocol was followed. But again, this is not the case and it is unfairly hurting my credit score. The evidence that I have to support this is my credit worthiness, history, and behavior. Prior to this incident, I had a XXXX  credit score of XXXX and since then it has dropped to XXXX. Ive had multiple credit accounts in my 15 years of credit history that includes car loans, home loans, and credit cards and my credit history speak for itself. I have never been late, Ive never exceeded my credit limit, never spend irresponsibly, etc. I rack up more than {$2000.00} worth of credit expenses per month and every month it is paid in FULL and on time. Ive asked Macys to use common sense in this situation and realize that a late payment on such a small amount is completely out of character, based on my credit worthiness and payment history. Ive had the Macys card for 6 years and never have I been late ( nor any other loan, credit card, etc. ). Ive sent in documents to support this as well via email and via post and this does not see to be taken into account. Although Macys claims they sent everything, I can tell you that is not the case. Why wouldnt Macys realize this given my history? Why wouldnt Macys realize that perhaps even though they sent everything they claim the sent, that maybe I did not receive it? Mail is lost all the time in cyber space and via post. Why doesnt Macys give its loyal customer the benefit of the doubt especially when I prove that it is completely out of my credit history? At which point is my word accepted as true? If I were irresponsible with credit and my history showed this, that is another story and I would have no right to file claim after claim and dispute this derogatory mark. Clearly, this is not the case and I wish Macys would accept responsibility. I realize companies do not want to set precedents, and I understand that, but clearly, there is a problem here. Justice is not being served and Im wrongfully being hurt here. Again, I had to depend on a 3rd party to be notified. Macys did not properly notify its customer which is disappointing, unfortunate, and startling. This is small potatoes so not sure why I have to get to this point in order to resolve this problem. I've jumped through so many hoops and I'm continuing to do so all for an {$8.00} payment in which I was not properly notified. Enclosed you will find proof of my credit history and response from Macys with regards to the XXXX   claim. Macys is simply reiterating everything that occurred ( which I already know ) and is not helping.

The first request was put in writing to billing disputes e-mail department on XXXX. The second request was placed in writing to billing disputes on XXXX. To date, I have failed to receive any supporting documentation. I have also asked for supporting documentation through the CFPB twice on all my disputes and Citibank has failed to provide them to date. 
I have withdrawn all the disputes for the year from XXXX XXXX, and I am attempting to work out a resolution directly with them. Citibank is making it impossible for me to come to a resolution due to failing to provide supporting documentation as requested. I have had problems with this location for several years now. I have complained directly to the store in person, over the phone, and in writing,, I have filed a prior XXXX  report, I have called their regional office, and more recently I have discussed the problem with their district manager. 
On XXXX, I spoke to XXXX in billing disputes regarding these transactions. He stated Citibank had paid the merchant on several of these transactions : the one for {$9.00} dated XXXX ; the XXXX for {$7.00} dated XXXX ; the one for {$7.00} dated XXXX ; the one for {$7.00} dated XXXX ; the one for {$4.00} dated XXXX ; the one for {$7.00} dated XXXX ; and the one for {$8.00} dated XXXX. To date, Citibank has reversed the following charges : {$9.00}, {$7.00}, {$7.00}, {$4.00}, and {$7.00}. XXXX stated he couldnt provide details of what was disputed because he didnt have access to it. 
In addition to paying the merchant, Citibank issued me permanent credits with no documentation required. If the merchant disagreed with the dispute, they still paid the merchant, coded my dispute as misrepresented, charged the disputed amount off on their P & L sheets, and let the supposed misrepresented disputes pile up. Then, right before mailing my rewards check for the year ( nearly {$1000.00} ), they closed my account and kept the check. 
On XXXX, I spoke to XXXX in billing disputes around XXXX XXXX. She also stated she could not access specific information about the disputes. I told her about my multiple requests by e-mail, over the phone, and to the CFPB. She stated she would research the problem and would make sure all the appropriate paperwork was sent my US mail and also to my Notices and Letters section of my e-mail. She put me on hold, stated she finally found the requested information ( apparently only submitted recently ), and said I should get the paperwork shortly. Hands down, she has been the most helpful representative I have spoken to so far. 
Once this matter is settle with XXXX XXXX, I plan on sending Citibank all the supporting documentation on the refunded disputes and request that they properly code the disputes as not misrepresented. I am absolutely worn out by Citibanks ineptitude. 
I am sending screen shots of all the dispute withdraws. I am sending screen shots of all the e-mails written to billing disputes since the XX/XX/XXXX. I am also including an XXXX worksheet of the XXXX XXXX disputes. I am alse sending a PDF file of my transaction history rebill. I expect Citibank to start to do their jobs and to get me all the dispute documentation including the merchants response, including whether Citibank claims the dispute was mis-represented.

The billing address is XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX  TX XXXX. 

Since I opened this MC more than 3 years ago, I have it set up to auto draft, in amount of full statement balance, from my XXXX  account ending in XXXX. 

I do not receive paper statements from Citi Bank. 

This XXXX when I checked account activity it showed I was still set up for auto-draft and my bank account information was up-to-date. However, my account showed a 'late payment ' warning, and a {$60.00} late payment fee for a {$20.00} statement balance. 

Autodraft prevents my account from EVER being late, if Citi bank is following the contract. In addition, if they decided they needed to stop autodraft, for any reason, I should have been notified. 

I attempted to contact Citi bank in a variety of ways. Their phone auto message indicated they did not have customer service reps. answering calls, and suggested I down load an app for communication. I down loaded the app and texted a message ; they company did not respond. I emailed and started a 'chat ' with a rep. on line through an account link. The message from the app was as follows : "" sounds like you need to talk to a customer representative. They are no longer available at this time. Please tell us how we are doing. '' I am worn out from this customer indifference and wish to close my account, but can not get through to do so. Adding insult to injury, the {$20.00} service on the credit card, for "" XXXX XXXX, ' was a recurring service I canceled a month ago and should not have been charged for.

When I received it, I found out it required a {$450.00} annual fee, due immediately. I destroyed the card and called Citibank on XX/XX/20 to cancel the card. I spoke to a representative who convinced me to keep the card and she would waive the fee for the first year. They sent me a new card. I then received a bill from Citibank for {$450.00} and called them back. Another customer service representative told me that the first person was wrong and that there was no way to waive the fee. So, again, I told them I wanted to cancel. He asked me several times if I was sure and then told me to destroy my new card and that the account was closed. 

After that, I received one bill for {$450.00} and thought this was billing made before my cancellation. Yesterday, I received another bill and called Citibank. This time I was told that 37 days had passed since my first bill and therefore there was no way to avoid the {$450.00} fee. The representative now said she was successful in canceling my card, but I would still have to pay the fee. Of course, I was very angry, but the woman told me there was nothing I could do. 

Now I have no card and owe them {$450.00}. I will be sending them a certified letter tomorrow to escalate the dispute as suggested by the FTC.

02/23/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"This is regarding dispute number XXXX. 

Because of the way Citibank billing disputes has handled my account, I need to verify through their executive office that this charge was resolved in my favor and the merchant was not paid for this transaction. I e-mailed additional information to billing disputes on XX/XX/XXXX despite Citibank issuing me a permanent credit with no additional documentation required.

The original amount of the bill was {$46.00}, the disputed amount was {$17.00}. The charge was made on XX/XX/XXXX, it was disputed on XX/XX/XXXX, and it was resolved in my favor on XX/XX/XXXX as a permanent credit with no other documentation required. Despite Citibank not requiring documentation, I am providing additional information for your records. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the merchant. I spoke to XXXX, the manager that originally agreed to credit the bill. XXXX remembered the complaint. He apologized for failing to issue the bill credit and stated they were extremely busy training new employees during that time period, mistakes were being made in the kitchen, and he and the server should have made sure the refund was issued. I also discussed a prior dispute with similar outcomes dated back in XX/XX/XXXX and again addressed with him the problems we have had habitually at this location over and above these disputes. I further submitted a complaint on their corporate website over the weekend prior to talking to him, although the location had not been alerted to the complaint yet. I told him no additional compensation was needed above and beyond the disputed amount, so they are not sending me a gift card to compensate for the problems. 

So, Citibank should not have paid the merchant on this dispute. 

Another problem with this dispute is what is listed on the dispute summary. It states the purchase was made on XX/XX/XXXX. I accidentally typed in XX/XX/XXXX when I e-mailed billing disputes when I should have typed in XX/XX/XXXX. The purchase was made on XX/XX/XXXX. The reason why I made the error is because I based my dates off of the dispute summary. So, at some point, someone in billing disputes made a date entry error, because again, the date of purchase is incorrect through the billing dispute 's department. I am including a screen print of my dispute summary, a screen print of the transaction history showing the original date of purchase, as well as the date the conditional credit for dispute was issued. 

My statement reflects the conditional credit for the dispute was posted on XX/XX/XXXX. This is prior to the purchase date as clearly listed on the statement. On the following statement dated XX/XX/XXXX, it shows the conditional credit for dispute was resolved on XX/XX/XXXX. Prior to now, I have not been actively reading my statements. I have just gone off of the transaction history and the interest billed on my transaction history, calculating the interest in my head. 

I am including this following files in this document : the dispute summary, a copy of the e-mail to billing disputes, my transaction history showing the date of purchase and the conditional credit, and my billing statements.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",KS,660XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/23/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3541146

In XXXX I received a notification that I should take advantage of another offer, that would end in XX/XX/XXXX, at 1 % APR, for which it also had a 3 % balance transfer fee. Seeing the opportunity, I transfer some other debt that I had with this offer. 

Come close to XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that my payments were not reducing the amount for the offer that was going to be finished in XX/XX/XXXX, I even made a huge payment to remove the balance for that debt, but it was applied to the offer that would end in XXXX.

I requested them to go and apply my big payment to the account saying that it does not make sense to apply it to something that was going to expire in XXXX. 

In other credit services, there is a way for the consumer to choose how balances are applied because set rules are not always the best for the customer, and at least you let the customer make the mistake, but it is not fair that the financial institution sets you up with an offer, misguide you on how the payments are made and trow your financial planning out of the window in order to collect additional interest.

06/09/20,Checking or savings account,Personal line of credit,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Greetings CFPB : This message is about a closed Citibank revolving credit line still being reported as open. Thank you for receiving my complaint. 

I opened a revolving credit line with Citibank ( IL ) in XXXX, called "" Ready Credit '' ( now called "" Checking Plus '' ), and paid it in full satisfactorily during XX/XX/XXXX ( this is currently confirmed by Citibank reporting to credit bureaus ). It was closed at that time, and my available credit was reduced to XXXX. 

Now, nearly ten years later, that account is still listed on my online banking profile within the bank itself. I have tried to remove it but they say it is closed and not to worry. They do not seem to know how to remove this old account. The XXXX  available credit currently reported also negatively impacts my credit utilization, doubling the negative effect of this decades-long situation. That lower credit score has caused me to suffer from higher interest rates, particularly high-value ones like the 30 year mortgage I obtained in XXXX, and hope to refinance to a rate reflective of my true credit worthiness. 

I have tried to get this removed with Citibank directly, and also disputed it with the credit bureaus, to no avail. Citibank reaffirms their reporting, despite simultaneously reporting that the account has XXXX balance and XXXX  credit available since XXXX, and that there has been no balance nor any credit availability for a decade. I am helpless in this situation. 

Kindly request that they correct their information system and accurately report the status of my relationship with them to the credit bureaus. This account was closed.

03/03/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Getting a credit card,Application denied,"For over 20 years I have had a Best Buy store card to make big purchases. On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, my wife and I decided to buy new kitchen appliances and we thought we would put the purchase on my Best Buy credit card given they were offering 18 months of financing. Why use our cash flow when we can take advantage of such a great promotion. The sales rep helped us pick out new appliances totaling over {$4000.00}. When I attempted to use my Best Buy credit card I was told I would have to reactivate my card given it had been awhile since I used it. So I entered my application information and was declined for a Best Buy credit card. I was however, approved for a Citibank Gold Visa for a {$59.00} fee! I had no idea at the time I applied I was actually being evaluated for 3 different types of credit cards offered through Citibank. There was no full disclosure on the screen and I was not allowed to only apply for the Best Buy credit card which was the only card I was interested in having. When I asked why I didn't qualify for a Best Buy credit card Citibank wouldn't tell me why until I received the letter. My wife works for XXXX and of course went nuts when she heard this because we always pride ourselves on have low debt and good credit. Needless to say we almost walked away from the sale and I was horrified to be denied the Best Buy credit card that I've held for so many years. We decided to put the purchase on our XXXX card instead and decided this will be the last purchase we make at Best Buy due to the relationship they hold with Citibank. 

After the purchase I went home and called Citibank back and spoke with a manager with the help of my wife. The manager confirmed that a model decisioned my application and that I was declined due to insufficient credit experience. I asked what credit report was pulled and was told it was Experian so I immediately went online and pulled my credit report. The ironic thing is I have less than 5 % debt, my FICO score is above 800, I have 9 open accounts including an {$18000.00} VISA through XXXX  XXXX XXXX, as well as several other store credit cards similar to Best Buy where you can only make purchases at the store. I have a total of XXXX in available credit to use!!!! On top of that, I had 33 credit card offers available for me to explore including 2 from Citibank! I have no mortgage because it's in my wife 's name ( she owned the house before we married ) and I paid off a card loan 3 years ago so I have no installment loans. I never thought that would make me eligible to be declined due to insufficient credit experience and neither did my wife. She feels I was declined because I would not be profitable for Citibank given my great credit history. I was only offered a {$59.00} annual fee Visa through Citibank which is insane and they are treating me like I have barely any credit which is not the case. When I reviewed my credit report I noticed that XXXX  XXXX previously held the Best Buy portfolio and I never had a problem getting approved for an account. Now that Citibank owns the portfolio, they are attempting to qualify customers for their VISA and are forcing good quality credit customers like myself to pay an annual fee given we are deemed not profitable. This practice is unfair and deceptive! I am attaching copies of the decline letter, as well as screen images from my XXXX credit report showing the information I've stated in this complaint.

I checked out the website and they had a XXXX XXXX, California address so I felt comfortable making this purchase. Immediately after I made the purchase, I received an email confirmation from XXXX for a purchase from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Right then, my alarm bells went off? Who is this person? I purchased a jersey from XXXX  XXXX. I began XXXX  the companys website and multiple sites came up saying that this was a scam. Embarrassed, I prayed I was wrong and the item be real and arrive. A few days later, I received an email with a tracking link and I began tracking it. The shipment was stalled for weeks. On XX/XX/XXXX, I wrote the company and requested an update.

I began to panic. On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed the package had arrived in New York. I again emailed the company and was told it would reach me soon. When the item did arrive on XX/XX/XXXX, I opened it and began to cry. It was 100 % counterfeit. ( please see attached photo ). The yellow lining was multiple different colors, the XXXX logo on the collar was fake and it looked as fake as possible. I immediately emailed the company and notified them that the item looks fake and requested a refund. I have never heard back. Immediately, I filed a dispute with Citi Bank. I have attached my email logs, XXXX receipt, my initial email confirmation from XXXX XXXX   and a photo of the jersey. If you look for the companys website XXXX  XXXX, it does not exist. This company is a fraud and they scammed me. Please do not let a confirmation receipt on their part suffice as evidence as they have used multiple email accounts, the website no longer exists, many people online have complained about being scammed and they produced a counterfeit item which is illegal. Finally, these people ripped off people during the holidays. I am a hard working mom who was buying a XXXX  present for my husband. It is sad and upsetting.

I again contact Citibank via online chat and was again told they would inform their superiors via email of the pending credit and should receive it. Again, I never did. After waiting twice for two hour hold time and then being disconnected due to long wait time, I finally poke with someone who told me they would file a fraud charge on the card and it would be escalated for review. At that time, the representative changed my card number.I received a letter rejecting the dispute claim before I have even received my new card.

05/15/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"I had a Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select credit card. I received a statement for the billing period XX/XX/20 - XX/XX/20 that had a balance of {$350.00}. Payment due date was XX/XX/20. I attempted to make the full payment on XX/XX/20. However the credit card company credited the payment on XX/XX/20 and charged me a late payment fees of {$25.00} and interest of {$4.00}. I called Citicard in XXXX and attempted to get the late charges and interest charges removed. The representative said that he was having 'system ' problems and he would take care of it. I requested that my account be closed and he closed my account. In my account statement of XX/XX/20 - XX/XX/20 the late payment charge and interest charge was still there and the balance owed was {$30.00}. I assumed that this would be removed as the representative had told me and the account would be closed. 

In the account statement covering period XX/XX/20 - XX/XX/20 another late payment charge of {$25.00} was added with interest of XXXX cents for a grand balance of {$56.00}. I called today and spoke to a representative and explained the problem that this account had been closed a couple of months back after i had paid the full amount and the Citi representative that time had agreed to remove the late charges and close the account. Instead of removing another late payment charge of {$25.00} had been added plus XXXX cents of interest. This representative attempted to help but was unable to because the 'system ' would not let him. He escalated this up to someone who escalated this further up but to no avail. The 'system ' would not let them remove the 2 late charges of {$25.00} each plus the accumulated interest. This whole process took half a day of my time. So my complaint is about this imaginary 'system ' that allows Citi to get away by imposing late charges on late charges. I attempted to close the account after paying the balance in full 2 months ago and here I am still owing Citicard.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",VA,None,Older American,Consent provided,Web,05/15/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3653907

My period to spend {$20000.00} was only from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. During this period I only spent ~ $ XXXX. This is where I caught them in a lie. I have the original email that speaks about the promotion ( attachment ). I have copy/pasted the exact wording of the promotion below. The promotion states that you need to spend {$20000.00} "" every 12 months from the billing period after your annual fee bills. '' My {$95.00} membership fee is paid in XXXX. My interpretation of this wording is that I need to spend $ XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I don't know why a reasonable person would think the period would start XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX ( less than 12 months ). Please review the below promo language and let me know what you think. I can verify that I spent over $ XXXX during the 12 month period so I believe the promo applies to me. If they meant the period started in XXXX the advertising should have stated XXXX. 

At this point it is not about the money. It is about principal. Every time I call Citi I have to listen to a 10 minute prompt before I am even able to talk to a representative. They go through troves of information ( account balance, miles balance, last time I paid, ect. ) before you have the ability to hear the dial prompt. This is designed to make people give up. I have spent hours trying to resolve this issue. They give me lack of details when I speak with them and send a rejection letter without an easy way to contact someone. I will keep the # 2 and # 3 rejection letters. Please review the wording below and tell me how you interpret the promotion. Do you think the period is 12 months or do you think the period to spend $ XXXX is 8 month? Citibank is a large corporation and I am just one person. It is frustrating I had to take these steps to get my {$100.00} promotion. 

Transcript of the Promo wording "" Earn a {$100.00} XXXX XXXX Flight Discount ( the "" Flight Discount '' ) after you spend {$20000.00} or more in purchases on your Citi / AAdvantage Platinum Select card during your cardmembership year ( every 12 months from the billing period after your annual fee bills through the next billing period your annual fee bills. ) For your first year of cardmembership, purchases qualify as of the date of your account opening.

I had vacation notifications set with Citibank, listing the places I was going.I was available by phone at all times. I charged my airline tickets, hotel reservations and rental car on the Citibank credit card. At no time while on vacation was I contacted about activity on my account in California while I was in South Dakota and surrounding area. When I finally was contacted later in XXXX, I disputed the fraud charges then I waited until XXXX to hear back from Citibank that I was liable for the fraud on my account because the charges were "" chip enabled ''. I tried in vain to explain that, that was not correct, one charge, for example, was an online movie rental, impossible to charge by chip. They would not listen to reason. When I tried to contact Citibank I was told since the case was closed. They no longer would discuss it on the phone but I could submit further documentation by mail. I sent a series of both registered and regular mail letters and never received a response. I went to my local branch and was told they could not help me. I appealed to the bank manager who gave me a new phone number of a "" supervisor '' named XXXX XXXX, in the fraud department. She listened to my story, told me that the decision was "" set in stone '' but she would get back to me and I have never heard from her again. I contacted XXXX XXXX for assistance and they told me to file a police report which I did. This was submitted to Citibank. When I called to follow up with my case I was told they never received the police report. When I asked if they wanted me to resend it they said that wasn't necessary because their credit cards can not be duplicated. It was sent again anyway after the fax number was confirmed to be correct. I am now getting collection calls because I did not pay the fraudulent charges and my FICO score has been affected. I can not reach anyone who will look into the details of my case and see that it is impossible to make charges in 2 different states on the same day. Citibank only ever gave me one credit card which was in my possession at all times. Clearly it is possible to duplicate their  card because it happened. I need to get these charges and accrued interest reversed from my account. I am obviously not using the card any longer.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,926XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/21/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3540395

We changed our address three times while on our mission. so our mail would be forwarded each time. When we finished the mission XX/XX/XXXX, we did not return to XXXX but relocated in XXXX.

XX/XX/XXXX I made a purchase at Macy 's with my Macy 's card, the amount was {$130.00}, as I recall. However, the bill never reached us, as the address on the Macy 's card was a Washington address. 
The problem was discovered on XX/XX/XXXX, when our credit score was checked and we were apprised of the debt applied against my score. I immediately paid it off with late fees ; {$140.00}. XXXX. Included is my bank statement showing the payment. 
I errantly assumed the problem was resolved. We are now about to buy a home and to my chagrin, I discovered this blight on my credit is to last 7 years! 
Macy 's asked me to provide a confirmation number from the Post Office showing we had changed our address. The P.O. sent the last confirmation number, which didn't work, and would not have shown the original change of address which was the address Macy 's had. 
Since I can't get the P.O. to send a history of our address changes, I would like Macy 's to grant me a "" Good Will Adjustment. '' This is an unfortunate mistake. They sent the bill to an old address. The bill was not forwarded. I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience. I would have paid it immediately, had I received it. This error does not justify a blight on my credit for 7 years! Point of logic : You agree to sell, I buy, both parties are happy ; if we agree to sell/buy, but I fail to pay on time or in full, you add a penalty to the purchase and threaten to make harm my good name ; if I pay all you are whole and so am I. Now, enter upon the modern age : you sell and I buy, but I ( for whatever reason ) fail to pay on time or in full, so you add a penalty and threaten to harm my good name ; but after I pay all you SHOULD BE WHOLE and I should be likewise. Not so, you are free to do significant harm to my good name for seven years!

I then proceeded to make an ONLINE purchase for a dishwasher as my current residence is in HI. Apparently when the order was placed it ( XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX ), the dishwasher was in the state of HI. After multiple phone calls to the installation crew as to why the dishwasher hadn't been installed to the VA property, we found out that the installers ( based in VA ) never called to let anyone know that they could not install the dishwasher because the dishwasher was in a HI warehouse. After many phone calls we had found this out and were able to receive a refund on the HI dishwasher in order to purchase a dishwasher in a VA warehouse that could be installed ( XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ). As you can see quite a bit of time from the original purchase. I thought the case was closed ; refunded for the 1st dishwasher due to a mix up and the appropriate one purchased and installed. Until, XXXX XXXX I was looking at my account and saw these letters in my message center from XX/XX/XXXX, stating that the conditional return of {$800.00} was being reversed and that I was recharged the {$800.00}. I do not look at this account all the time and just login to pay the bill as it is for appliances. To my horror, Sears reapplied that {$800.00} charge and I have been paying for an appliance for 2 years that I never had installed. When I started contacting Sears to  have it fixed, I have been getting nothing a run around and even one stating that their phones are busy and I should try back tomorrow. 
Now XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a gentleman that I thought was very helpful. He created a new case number and gave me a direct line to the case management site. He also state that someone would contact me within a week. Fast forward to today XX/XX/XXXX and I call to figure out what is going on and the woman asks if this is about a return of dishwasher from XXXX. I stated the situation and she asks me why I am seeking this refund now. First, it's not a refund it is a fraudulent charge. Then proceeds to tell me that "" this is odd '' and the case was closed because it is past the return period. I have asked to speak with a manager and having now been on the phone for over 4HOURS being tossed around and on hold. Sears fraudulently charged for a dishwasher and can not customer assistance to help rectify it. I have detailed conversations with all of the associates and the dates and times that I have spoken to them. I feel so violated and ripped off by this company.

I received an email on XX/XX/XXXX saying that my account is now open and I can go ahead an deposit funds into my account. Copy of email is attached. 

I set up the required direct deposit soon after and deposited the {$15000.00} in my account on XXXX XXXX which got credited into my account on XXXX XXXX. Copy of bank statement attached. 

After that, I waited until XXXX of XXXX for my bonus. Upon noticing that I have not been paid the bonus yet, I called up the bank thrice. I was told that I will NOT BE PAID THE BONUS. The reason given was that PER THE BANK, THE {$15000.00} DEPOSIT WAS MADE AFTER 30 DAYS AS THEY CALCULATE 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THE ACCOUNT APPLICATION WAS SUBMITTED AND NOT THE DATE WHEN ACCOUNT WAS OPENED. 

I believe I fulfilled all the conditions and the bank never provided any such special clarifications about the account opening date in their terms and conditions or fine print. 

Upon doing an internet search, I found many forums where people have mentioned one or the other strange reason for which Citi Bank had denied bonuses to people.

Unfortunately it was for a my account that had cancelled earlier with Citibank ( since they couldn't stop a fraud charge monthly coming through, they said they would block it, they never did ) .So we couldn't file a dispute claim on line the 'usual ' way. 

We couldn't reach Citibank by telephone as they never picked up the phone after waiting 1 1/2 hr on line ; and at that time Citibank also removed their chat button too on their website So we ( myself and wife ) wrote a letter to Citibank, faxed it to them XX/XX/XXXX to fax # XXXX & XXXX.

I said "" didn't you read the letter, it clearly reads I cancelled the transactions, showed proof of the transactions, it isn't fraud. I am trying to have you file a dispute ''. He said "" then I can't help you I am only in fraud ''.

Accounts involved : XXXX, XXXX. Accounts are in the name of Mrs XXXX XXXX, and are managed by my spouse, XXXX 's daughter, XXXX XXXX as Power of Attorney. 
Account XXXX, in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX Estate. Also managed by XXXX XXXX, daughter of the late XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Finally our personal checking account XXXX which was started 40 years ago. 

The problem : In the first week of XX/XX/2020, we noticed several checks that had been attempted to be deposited to all the accounts above. The amount was the same in almost all : {$4700.00}. All checks bearing addresses from upstate New York were made payable to XXXX XXXX. Most checks included XXXX 's complete Social Security Number, which in itself should have been a red flag. 
The next step of the fraud was made in person, where someone impersonating my wife XXXX, went to a Citi Branch in Illinois and made withdrawals using my wife 's PIN number, and ( or ) my number, when it came to our joint checking account.This also should have raised a flag. It did not. The signature of my wife was imitated very badly in this process and her name misspelled. Another red flag ignored. Our signatures have been on record for 40 years. A Video of this person exists. 

We brought all this to the attention of the branch management and they contacted the Citi fraud unit and told them unequivocally that these transactions were not made by us. They also told them that they had spoken to the management of the Illinois branch about it. 
We have not travelled to that State.We have never been accused of a crime. 
We have spent countless hours going to the branch in our neighborhood speaking to our customer service rep, Assistant Manager and the Citi fraud Unit during these dangerous times. 
We have also spent hours speaking to the Fraud Unit from our home while quarantined. Last time was today while at the branch. 
The Fraud Unit contrary to the determination of the Branch management, told XXXX that there would be no compensation for us, while offering no tangible- factual reasons. 

Remarkably, the exact same treatment was offered to me, XXXX XXXX, about 2 years ago, when my Citi credit card was defrauded via a non chip credit terminal at a store. 
Only after my complaint to this agency did my then nightmare ended. 

It is obvious to anyone with a brain, that a Citi employee stole all our personal info, PIN numbers included and perpetrated this crime with Citi 's negligence as a helper. 
Their recalcitrant/indifferent response is an insult to us on top of injury.

She first added me to her Citi card in XXXX, around XXXX/XXXX, when I first moved to the U.S. 

We had a slight upset in our marriage around XXXX XXXX and she removed me from her card. Things were fixed and I was added back to the card around XX/XX/XXXX, 8 months ago. 

Since then I have made numerous calls to Citi Bank and the credit agencies to find out why this card is not being reported properly as it doesn't show up on any credit report. I have used my card multiple times so we know that isn't an issue. 
Citi Bank say they're reporting correctly and the credit agencies say there aren't any problems their end. Essentially I'm stuck in the middle and no one will take accountability as to why this credit card isn't showing on my report, choosing to blame the other instead. 

Since being added as an authorized user in XX/XX/XXXX I have obtained various lines of credit that have all been reported fine, one being another credit card and the other being a car lease. There has been no issue reporting either to the credit agencies.

I have received 3 letters from Citi Bank stating they are reporting correctly, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX however this does not seem to the the case. 

Every time I call Citi Bank for an update they confirm my personal information and tell me to wait 30 days. The first few months they had the incorrect SSN for me, they only noticed after several phones calls from myself. The next few months I noticed they weren't using the correct credit card number so I wouldn't ; t have been associated with that account. It seems like there has been numerous errors at Citi Bank and I'm the one suffering.

Today XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to Citi Bank following up with my latest enquiry only to find out nothing has been done for 3 weeks. Allegedly they tried to call my wife to confirm SSN, DOB and our names. I have been told to wait another 30 days.

This card is in good standing, payments are not missed and I am losing out on the benefits to my credit report. Even if it was 1 point a month that's still 8 points. We also pay an annual fee for this card which seems  insulting given the lack of service received.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CO,809XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/04/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3593030

Citi said they would only refund {$39.00} of the charge. Citi says Citi is at your side before, during and after every purchase.. In this case, I was left stranded in a foreign country, and had to look for alternate lodging.

I originally made this reservation with the intent on staying two nights. Upon arriving to the hotel, I began the checkin process. As the hotel representative was describing the room, he said it had a fan and good air flow. I paused and asked him if it had air conditioning, per the room details on XXXX. He paused for a moment and said no air conditioning I then mentioned the room reservation said air conditioning, and he said Ok and proceeded to check us in. Prior to him finishing, I asked if I could view the room as it seemed a bit skeptical given his original response. He took us to a room that was not as described in the listing. 
The air conditioner was not working. It was blowing room temperature air. He said the air conditioner would get colder, yet we stood there for 5 minutes and it was the same temperature. It was clear this was not working, as there was a flashing light indicator on the air conditioner that was indicating there was a problem. I asked if there was another room and he said no. Also, the room was currently occupied as there was a bag, toiletries, sandals, and a backpack in the room so it wasnt available for check-in at that time ( Im not even sure the room he showed us was the one we would receive ). Additionally, the room had a musty smell, like smoke or another substance. On the listing smoke free, and given XXXX it was not an option. 
I have contacted XXXX three times on this matter. The final time, the best they said they could provide is a credit for future use. I do not want a credit for future use, so I declined this option from them. I have transcript of the final conversation where they said they would not issue a refund.

The Company has yet to provide a satisfactory response and has refused to compensate for the financial loss that they caused. Please refer to my previous complaints for more details : XXXX XXXX XXXX Long story short, the bank froze my family savings account for undetermined period under pretense of my account being reviewed by the "" back office '' of Fraud department. They provided no means whatsoever for me to resolve the issue and unfreeze the money. After submitting multiple complaints to XXXX  and CFPB, they then decided to close my account for unknown reason. 

After 63 days, they finally closed the account and returned my money. But no explanation was given even after multiple request to provide an explanation. 

Anyway during those 63 days, I lost hundreds of dollars because I needed to take a loan ( because my money was being used by Citi ). I lost another hundreds of dollars of not putting it in my other account that earnings MUCH higher interests. 

From my perspective, Citi stole my money for 63 days because they STILL failed to provide me an explanation of : ( 1 ) why the account was frozen, and ( 2 ) why my account was closed. 

Those 63 days may mean nothing for the company, but it meant lost of hundreds of dollars for my family and the Company is not owning responsibility for it.

For example, the purchase : XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX GA, {$260.00}. This purchase earned only one offer, not both. There is no reason for that. It's not the cap, because orders after this date have qualified for both orders. 

I open a complaint, and a few days later I received a later simply stating : We have reviewed your account and show that your ThankYou Network accumulation is correct. 

How good is that? No explanation as to why the other offer did not apply to that purchase.

I RECENTLY PAID OFF MY CREDIT CARD WITH MACY 'S AS IT WAS BEING HANDLED BY A CONSUMER DEBT MANAGEMENT COMPANY. THE ACCOUNT IS CLOSED AND IS NOW PAID IN FULL.

MACY 'S STILL HAS IT ALSO LISTED AS "" CONSUMER DEBT MANAGEMENT COMPANY MAKING PAYMENTS '' IN THE COMMENT SECTION OF THEIR REPORTING.

05/28/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"I had some fraudulent charges on my Citi Bank Credit Card account from last year. In XX/XX/2020 I spoke to Citi bank to dispute the charges and asked for them to be removed and the account to be closed. 
The citi bank rep asked me to make a payment of {$300.00} - which were legitimate charges, which I did, this left a balance of {$140.00} which the agent said would be removed and the account would be closed as i'd requested. On the online account it states 'this account is closed ' To me this meant I would have a zero balance. I have not used the card since. 
Yet, each month I have received a statement from Citi with accrued interest now totaling $ 250+ and the collections department has been called in to collect on my bad debt with Citi . 
I have called Citi Bank on at least 5 occasions over the past couple of months and have been passed from one department to another being told that they would resolve the matter. 
Today I was on the phone for an hour and a half with Citi and was passed to 5 different departments - some twice, and still the matter is not resolved. 
If an account is closed why is interest being accrued? 
I have also written a letter to mail to every citi bank address I can find to try to resolve this issue - there is no email address and all phone customer service seems to be non XXXX Based. 
This is not fair to me, this will also put a negative mark on my unblemished credit report. 
All I want is for this to be resolved as I was told it was in XXXX - now 5 months later, it still isn't and I am paying for it financially with interest accruing each month. 
I want the public to be aware of how dishonest Citi Bank is to deal with.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,934XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,05/28/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3672831

The wheelset has a problem of cutting sidewall of tires. After speaking to XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( owner of XXXX XXXX ) on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I shipped my XXXX  to XXXX XXXX  on XXXX, XXXX and it was delivered on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. XXXX ( customer service ) at XXXX XXXX also confirmed the delivery of my return, but he stop replying my e-mails and I couldn't get any updates from him. I called XXXX XXXX and spoke to his colleague, but nothing happened. 

I filed a dispute with my Citi credit card, and the case has been resolved in my favor ( see attached ). Because I didn't see the credit applied to my account by the time I noticed ( from email ) that my case was resolved, I thought I have to withdraw my case to end the case and to get my credit back. It was only after I saw the paper mail notice ( see attached ) and the reverted credit on the recent bill that I realized that this wasn't right, Citi applied temporary credit to my account when I opened a dispute and reverted credit when I clicked on withdraw. 

But, how can a conditional permanent credit from a resolved case be reverted again? There are too many misleading things from my credit card service. 

After I spoke to the Citi dispute department, they insist that there's nothing they can do which is ridiculous. How can Citi design a system that allows customers to withdraw any resolved case cause revert of a conditional permanent credit? A resolved case on the web page should be closed, why do they give you a withdrawal bottom? They didn't provide clear information for the dispute procedure in the first place and they won't re-dispute for their customer.

Based on this date i made a minimum deposit of {$15000.00} ( wire transfer ) on XX/XX/2020 which was the latest appropriate date within the 30-day period. 
However my first bank statement indicated statement period from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/2020 that means my accounts was opened on XX/XX/2020 and Im not eligible to the Offer because my minimum deposit was late.

05/30/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers",Confusing or misleading advertising about the credit card,"Citi offered a promotion that if you open a savings account ( 1.66 percent at time of offer, now 1.55 but that is as expected, rate can fluctuate ) then your double cashback card ( which I had for many years a pays 1 % at purchase and 1 % at payment ) would go from 2 % to 2.5 % I tried recently to try to get confirmation that I was indeed getting 2.5, and for first 3 attempts I could get no answer, just a run around sending me to different departments.

Today I finally got someone on chat that said "" Yes you are eligible for the 2.5 %, call this number ( they gave me the wrong number it was the savings account support ), I am now on with an agent after a long hold and they are not helping, claiming I have to prove the offer ( there are many references to it with a simple XXXX search ). 

Here is a summary of my main complaint points. 
1/ if a bank or Credit card makes a promotional offer incentive like an increase in your credit card cashback rate it should be simple to validate. There should be a confirmation email saying you have the new cashback rate, and as well it should be easy for the consumer to see the information ( how much cashback am I getting if there are special deals ) on the website. 

2/ i feel very strongly this is a case of false advertising, everything implied there would be no action required by the consumer, and to make matters worse, there is NO WAY for the consumer to confirm he/she received the benefit after opening the savings account! No where in any of the transactions was there information that I must "" apply '' and I only found this out by checking. Now that I have the information that I must "" apply '', there is no simple process, no email that I can send, no ability in their chat support. In the time I have spent just to write this I am on my 4th person on the phone, in one case they just dropped me and transferred me to the debit card department. I am now with someone in the credit card department, and after explaining their first response was "" so you want to open a savings account ''. After patiently restating the situation and asking them to listen clearly, I am now on hold for a "" specialist ''. 

The close of the call wound up with this completely unacceptable situation A/ They did confirm that I should have the 2.5 % rate on my double cash card but do not B/ they gave me the account servicing number and the priority banking number which I have to call during the week, she could not get hold of anyone. She said that since there are two different departments involved credit card and banking, no one agent can handle the situation, and they have no support ticket that  can be opened, so bottom line instead of servicing me, I wasted hours with no solution other than putting the ball back in my court again I will be attempting to get them to active the rate and also retroactively honor it. 

here is one reference, its old and out of date, and the offer which was made via the website when I logged in is no longer there.

04/10/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"Hello Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Previously, I opened a claim with a complaint number : XXXX. To summarize what happened in the complaint, an unauthorized transaction posted on XX/XX/XXXX for - $ XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I was given a provisional credit of + $ XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the claim closed and - $ XXXX was taken away. When it was taken away, it was labeled Other Debit. I appealed this decision and WON THE APPEAL. However, Citibank still refused to pay me back. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Citibank responds to CFPB and states that they need more time to do the investigation. On XX/XX/XXXX, they conclude the investigation in my favor and sent a letter stating so. But since they never paid me back, I called and sent additional letters even after I won the appeal. 

Earlier today on XX/XX/XXXX, Citibank sends another letter that states : With regard to the {$1000.00} debit dated XX/XX/XXXX, we found that this debit is directly related to a request previously submitted using a debit card to fund your Citibank checking account ending with XXXX for {$1000.00}, which posted on XX/XX/XXXX. We received notification on XX/XX/XXXX, which indicated that a dispute had been filed by owner of the debit card used indicating that the funding transaction was unauthorized. 

THAT IS INCORRECT The transaction that posted on XX/XX/XXXX is a valid XXXX transaction from my XXXX account. On the Citibank notes it says XXXX Debit Card Balance Builder INTERNET XXXX. However, in the XXXX notes it says Quickpay With XXXX Payment To XXXX XXXX XXXX. I only made one transaction on the XX/XX/XXXX between those accounts and they match up. 

Somehow Citibank mislabeled the transaction of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX instead of XXXX payment. 

The transaction number for this is XXXX. 

I have also attached a screenshot ( in PDF format ) of the XXXX XXXX statement. It clearly shows a valid XXXX transaction that matches Citi. There was only one transaction that was made on XX/XX/XXXX. According to the letter sent to me, on XX/XX/XXXX, Citibank received notification that a dispute was filed by the owner ( which isnt true ). Because of this, the screenshot will show entries between the dates XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. If this was true and was really notified, there should be some type of reversal credit back to XXXX account between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

Before the Other Debit was the reversal of the provisional credit. Now they are stating Other Debit was the reversal of an unauthorized transaction on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Please help me! 

Thank you!

04/20/20,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"COMPLAINT : Sears Citi MasterCard fraud team is in denial of fraud in lieu of evidence and three other cards who determined fraud in a four way identity theft and fraud scam. The Federal Trade Commission states that card holders are not responsible for fraud and are entitled to their account information from the Bank Card companies. Sears Citi policy statements of denying fraud is the opposite of FTC and Florida state governments definition of identity theft fraud. 

From the beginning the experience with the Sears Citi fraud team was elusive compared to the other three companies who quickly determined fraud. Citi Sears intentionally avoided giving me statement information for seven months and have refused to give me the fraudulent application information that was critical component of fraud in the other three accounts who determined fraud. It is inappropriate to rule against me while Sears Citi is intentionally withholding information. Their excuses are ambiguous and continue to shift. In essence, the fraud team is aligned with the identity thief and their attitude encourages fraud by falsely attempting to blame the victim to hold responsible a system culturally biased against women dependent upon a husbands income. In this case husband has turned out to be a con artist. This is not just a marital issue, but identity theft crimes have been committed using my good credit, social security information and misleading information to be added to my two existing accounts as an authorized user and the fraudulent creation of two new credit card accounts in my name without my knowledge or permission. And in the case of XXXX XXXX XXXX card, the purchasing transactions are probably wire fraud. I invite any independent third party to review the ten months of my documentation and evidence by the three credit card companies to determine otherwise. 

This Sears Citi MasterCard account is one of four charge card accounts reported on my XX/XX/2019 FTC report of identity theft totaling over {$25000.00} balances by former con artist husband whom I am divorcing. Three of the other card accounts have acknowledged fraud and removed their balances : XXXX XXXX ; Citi Simplicity and XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX was an existing account like the Sears Citi whereas Citi Simplicity and XXXX XXXX XXXX were new accounts opened fraudulently. 

From the beginning Sears Citi account has been uncooperative : ( 1 ) Initially told me they could not help as fraud was not possible in a marital situation ( 2 ) Mis-represented and delayed for seven months giving me requested statements for me to evaluate the identity theft transactions as the mail was hidden by my husband. ( 3 ) Have refused to give me requested application profile copies of husband fraudulently adding himself as an authorized user to my account. ( 4 ) Gave me non sensible excuses ruling against me. Excuses include : a ) no such thing as marital fraud ; b ) I must have known about the fraud since I did not report it ; c ) I benefitted from the fraud ; d ) if fraud, why no police report ; etc All of these excuses to rule against me addressed in many months of correspondence. 

In the other three fraudulent accounts it was determined in the application processes were fraudulent -- identity thieves tend to be repetitive. It was only after I appealed to Sear Citi Bank president 's office after seven months that the statements were finally provided which show purchasing patterns and maxing out the balances identical to the other three fraudulent accounts. 

The appeal I provided to the presidents office included a folder full of correspondence confirming the fraud acknowledgments by the other three companies and the back and forth letters between Sears Citi representatives and me. The letters not only showed my numerous requests for account statements, but that I even sent back the irrelevant information they were sending so they could see what I was receiving -- thinking it was a mistake. Now I know it was intentional as they kept sending mis-information. The presidents office finally committed to send my statements after seven months of effort and I did receive them. But I never have received the application profile I requested numerous times verbally and in writing. My appeal to the presidents office was rejected, basically repeating the same obtuse reasons of their staff. 

On numerous occasions I was assured by staff that my account statements would be sent and on three occasions the same summary statement of credits and impossible interpretation of the numbers were mailed to me. I even mailed them back for the fraud team to see what I was actually receiving. I now believe it was intentional to prevent me from comparing to the other companies statements to match the trends and spending habits that were previously deemed fraudulent.

04/17/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"For XXXX credit reporting for my account at Citi bank ending in XXXX was notified late. Currently this account is under a payment program due to high interest rates I couldn't afford. This debt reduction non profit agency has helped to negotiate the rates lower and I am able to make lower payments than normal. I have never been late on this account. In XXXX due COVID related issues with mail and employees at companies not working I was unable to get hold of the agencies or Citi customer service the website was down and customer service was saying not available at this day even though it was during the day.

03/05/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I am currently a customer of Citibank. On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed 2 of my checking accounts were overdrawn, both my primary and my secondary checking accounts. My primary account was overdrawn - {$81.00} so I deposited in the amount of {$95.00} to bring the account current. A transaction presented was returned so my account was positive. 

Today on XX/XX/2020 I saw the account that was positive is now negative again. When I called Citibank I was inaccurately advied that it i a federal regulation and that the bank can offset any negative balance. 
I asked what regulation and after being placed on hold for almost 10 minutes, the agent XXXX returned to the line and quoted me that Regulation Z permits banks to offset depsotiory accounts. 
read reg Z online while on the phone with the agent and he gave me a link and told me that this is the law https : //www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/4000-6100.html. 
Upon viewing I advised XXXX that this is a depository offset as a result of a failed financial institution. 
I asked if Citi is a failed institution and XXXX resonded no. 

My concern is Citi is trying to mitigate risk and eliminate risk so I understand why they debited my positive account. 
However, they debited my account not accounting for the items pending. So in an effort to resolve 1 account they overdrew another. 
I called and advised them of this and asked why they would take out more money than I had when there are items pending. 

I was advised by supervisor XXXX that pending POS transactions don't count toward the balance. Because pending items can fall off Citibank takes into account the balance without factoring in the pending transactions. 

I felt that was a wrong practice. Pending transactions are authorized and are just waiting to post unless I advised otherwise and should have been factored into the balance when determining what the proper amount to debit was. 

Now in an effort to offset a negative balance, they created an overdraft. If they took the difference 1 account would be overdrawn not 2 again. 

This account received a bi-weekly direct deposit as does all of the accounts I have. 

When I addressed if they could reverse it they advised it could not be reversed. 
I asked if I could be considered for an OD refund and was advised I could not.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",TX,770XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/05/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3555467

04/16/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with customer service,"On XX/XX/2020 I tried calling Citibank after spending several hours online trying to research why I had a late payment fee added to my card account. I discovered that I had not received two paper statements in the mail. I rely on paper statements to set up my bill payments thru XXXX  XXXX XXXX 's bill payment system. I have not received paper statements a few times in the last five years, and I have always been able to contact Citibank customer service and request a courtesy fee waiver. Citi has been gracious enough to waive the late fee due to my long customer and on-time payment history. Knowing that during the current Covid 19 pandemic / crisis that Citi 's customer service department would be delayed I tried to pursue online means of contacting Citi : chat, sending a secure message through their system to no avail. None of these online published options were working or available. I searched for a fax # to send my request but could not find a published fax # anywhere, either online or on the paper statements I do you have in my possession. So finally, I called the customer service # XXXX at XXXX XXXX  Hawaiian time and was subsequently put on hold. I figured I could wear my headset, complete my work at home, make dinner, walk the dogs, and do other activities while on hold. I was on hold, with Citi 's music and notifications that kept repeating "" the next available customer service representative would attend to my call. '' This never occurred. After two hours or 120 minutes and 32 seconds, my call was cut off by Citibank, with no option to leave a message or have an agent return my phone call. There is literally no way to obtain customer service with this # 4 ranked in assets bank in the US, and # 11 ranked global bank in assets other than writing a letter and mailing it via US postal service., which I will do and mail out tomorrow, XX/XX/2020. 

They are a huge global bank and this is unacceptable, even during a pandemic/crisis. I feel that perhaps some employee and supervisor in a call center somewhere had a bet going on as to how long I would wait on hold before ending the call. They ignored my call and are probably laughing their heads off because of it. Again, unacceptable given the length of time I have been a customer and the size of this bank. 

My complaint has to do with Citi 's inability to provide customer service, by any means.

Primarily they made accessing statements and online information impossible, which resulting in late fees I feel are erroneous.

XX/XX/XXXX I called to complain again. I was told I must make a payment to bring my account current, which I did. This, I was told, would enable them to send a full history on my account as well as a replacement card. The replacement card is important, because I was told I could not re-gain online access until I had a new card. BUT- my online access was deleted by a Citibank associate when I called in XX/XX/XXXX.

I then spoke with manager XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) who refused to take off the {$39.00} fee.

I asked them to change my credit card from the XXXX XXXX Platinum card ( I'm no longer a fan of XXXX XXXX ) to a normal, cash-back card. However, they CLOSED my account of 28.5 years and opened a NEW account ( no credit history ) which immediately caused my credit score to drop from XXXX ( excellent ) down to XXXX ( 40 points ) while I am getting approved for a $ XXXX refi of mortgages.

I opened a 6 month CD with Citi Bank on XX/XX/2019, expecting to mature on XX/XX/2019, by definition of 6-month. To my surprise, it expired 2 days earlier, and automatically renewed into a new 6-month CD with 0.75 % interest rate. This was much lower than before and than competitors ', so I went to the branch to discuss with a banker on XX/XX/XXXX. She said had I talked to her a day earlier, it was still within the grace period, and they could have offered a much higher renewal interest rate for the new 6-month term, but that day I would have to pay penalty to change to the new rate ( at least 1.5 %, but I can not remember clearly ). I argued that I thought the original CD expired on XX/XX/XXXX by definition, so that day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) was still within 7 day grace period. She was empathetic and called Citi Headquarter to try to waive the penalty, but was declined. 

I found 3 fishy practices here : 1. Citi named it XXXXmonth CD : it started on XX/XX/2019, but it matured 2 days before XX/XX/2019. So the customer had a shorter window to respond to its inferior renewal offer. 
2. Citi has 7-day grace period for CD but competitors like XXXX and XXXX have 10-day.  Again, the customer had a shorter window to respond to its inferior renewal offer. 
3. As long as I talked to Citi within the grace period, I could have had much higher interest rate for no cost. Otherwise Citi would silently renew the CD with a very low interest rate. Citi is banking on customers ' ignorance and financial illiteracy to make a profit. 

4 days later, I paid the penalty and withdrew my CD money.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CT,06820,None,Consent provided,Web,05/08/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3643901
04/15/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"Since around XX/XX/2019 I have been trying to submit payment on my Costco Account with Citi Bank. On several occasions I have went online as well as called to make payment. Apparently when I was going online to make payment my payments were not being saved nor was my updated payment method. 

I have attempted on several occasions to contact Citi Bank and was given a general messages that I should call back later. Also when I have have attempted multiple times to pay online I would get errors from their online website. They use an automated calling system which I assumed was a telemarketing call. I ended up blocking the number because each time I would answer and hear a robot voice not a human voice. Come to find out it was City bank calling me to tell me that my payment was late. Again I had blocked the number as I do with many creditors because they are constantly trying to up sell me new loans. 

It is interesting though that they had my email and sent me email occasionally. More recently on XX/XX/XXXX they pitch me their online mobile app, between payment reminders. In fact every time I get an email notification I would logon when it would let me and attempt to make payment. 

My concerns : This creditor adverse reporting on my credit while they can not provided an effective online platform to submit payment. 

This creditor pitching credit service email with payment email and delay in email reminding customer of balance due. 

This creditor never sending written communication notifying of delinquent payment. 

This creditor using robo call methods to collecting debt in a world where ; I, the customer blocks such calls because of the problem with robocall abuse. 

My main concern is that this creditor benefits in charging late fees and negative credit reporting because their processes are inept. 

I have paid the late fees on a lousy {$60.00} annual fee for my Costco membership. For what its worth I have been a costco member for years I don't use their contract creditors much more than required for the annual membership fee. That said they  have changed their contract creditors maybe twice. City being the worst. 

My goal is to make certain that my credit is not affected by negative credit reporting. As far as the late fee I was inclined to pay so that I could close the account with XXXX balance. 

For what it is worth I have exceptional credit. In my opinion this Creditor has built a process that is so difficult to pay that they benefit from the late fee charges. 

I expect that any negative reporting be removed from this creditor. It would be wise to investigate to see if there is a pattern of difficulty submitting payment and excessive late fees. 

I was working with XXXX XXXX According to XXXX because of Citi bank and their delinquency it was more likely than not reported negatively on my credit. He made the excuse since I signed up with paperless reporting so they wouldn't have sent me a paper notification.

This month, on the XXXX my payment did not hit. I thought maybe there was a delay with all the coronavirus confusion. On the XXXX I went online to find it was indeed registered as late. I had to pay *double my min due* which I can not afford right now and was charged a late fee. 

I called them to figure it out what happened - "" we sent an updated terms and conditions in the mail ''. 
1 ) I never got a piece of mail from Citi 2 ) I opted for paperless ages ago anyway so I should get terms and conditions alerts electronically 3 ) Moreover, they did not have my permission to stop auto payments or any type of confirmation control in place to verify receipt of said terms and conditions 4 ) No one EVER reads those ... and they know it. 

I had to pay double my minimum payment due, and a late fee after only 5 days ... during a pandemic, homeschooling kids, trying to get by on one salary no less. I spoke to 4 managers and spent 1.5 hours on the phone when I was suppose to be home-schooling my kids. 

It is ~despicable~ that they would cancel my autopay without some type of confirmation process, give my 5 days to figure it out and offer no forgiveness or understanding during such trying times for people. What a scam! How many people didn't see their legal jargon snail-mail, or saw it and didn't read it, or saw it read it and didn't see the fine print.

02/15/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Billing Disputes, This is regarding dispute numbers D XXXX and D XXXX. Both purchases were through XXXX XXXX. 

D XXXX dated XXXX was for {$46.00}. I disputed the item on XXXX for {$18.00}. I disputed the item as goods/services not as received due to the condition of the pizza and XXXX  failing to issue a refund as promised. XXXX  acknowledged the error and refunded my card. Citibank has rebilled me for the transaction. 

D XXXX dated XXXX for {$42.00}. I disputed {$42.00} on XXXX due to the condition of the order and XXXX  failing to issue a refund as promised. I withdrew the case on XXXX because the merchant issued a refund. I proactively spoke to the merchant about this dispute as well due to Citibanks accusation that I had misrepresented disputes, specifically mentioning the {$18.00} dispute ( executive office employee XXXX ). To date, Citibank has not reversed the dispute on my account. I e-mailed billing dispute XXXX that I would withdraw the dispute when the charge came through on the account and explained they entered the amounts incorrectly. XXXX  messed up when processing the refund which was stated in the email. They entered it in two amounts : {$4.00} and then {$46.00}. So, it doesnt match the original disputed amount of {$42.00}. They actually refunded more than was due. I think he confused the refunds since the other purchase amount was {$46.00}. Seems he most likely ran {$4.00} first by accident and then ran it again for {$46.00}, although he stated something about confusing it with my tipped amount of 10 % on the {$46.00} bill. Who the XXXX knows at this point. I brought the error to his attention. He stated he didnt think it was a big deal, XXXX  has plenty of money, and he wasnt worried about getting me extra money back. As shown in the e-mail, I offered to repay him for the difference. He said no. Obviously, he couldnt rebill because the account is now closed. As you can clearly see by the e-mails, I explained in detail to one of the other managers who forwarded the e-mail to the other manager. It clearly breaks down the disputed amounts to {$18.00} and {$42.00}. The financial operations manager also has the right figures, because she pulled each dispute for investigation. I think the way he applied the refund is part of the rebill problem. Citibank isnt able to properly match up the figures. 

Finally, XXXXs operations manager thought they were not paid on these items initially. She stated, While I often send them copies of receipts for records, we don't actually expect to get anywhere with the disputes, as we don't have chip readers and therefore we're automatically considered at fault for any fraud/disputes either way. Anyways, here 's what I found with their card number : I received a chargeback from XX/XX/19 for XX/XX/19 for {$42.00}. I sent merchant services a copy of the receipt and just accepted the charges since it was noted as "" defective merchandise/services ''. I received a chargeback from XX/XX/19 for XX/XX/19 {$18.00} for a {$46.00} ticket. I sent merchant services a copy of the receipt. I marked on their checklist that I was sending them a signed copy of the receipt. I didn't leave any notes or state anything past that ... they often just ask for a copy of the ticket. Not sure why they told her we said they never complained. I wouldn't personally have knowledge on whether the guest complained. Not sure if merchant services would have talked to someone else or what? But I definitely didn't say anything to them. It is weird that the guest would go through merchant services rather than the restaurant for product/service issue. Normally that's just used for fraud ... so I understand why the credit card company might question whether they are trying to scam the system. I just checked our credit card processing system and it looks like the {$18.00} chargeback did hit our account. I'll paste a screenshot below. Is the guest asking about the {$18.00} because merchant services hasn't credited her or what is she needing? I'm not following that part. 
I told them it shouldnt matter whether they have a chip reader or not, all disputes should be handled the same way. I also stated disputes arent just used for fraud and referred them to the FTCs link on reasons for disputes. I reached out to billing disputes by e-mail, and XXXX  states they rapidly reached out to them. Here is the response : I have spoken with XXXX again and have ensured that everything financially is cleared on our end. Merchant services reached out from the bank, and we have verified that the purchases were made and were valid for credit. We are not sure why they would be saying we were refuting your dispute claims, however ... And we have been appropriately recompensed for the previously mentioned instances as well. 
There was a misunderstanding on my end initially, and I have applied the {$18.00} credit to your account today. You should see it posted to your Citibank account within the next 24 hours. 

Please let me know when the credit hits your account. 

Ive never been so confused on a dispute and the explanations involved in my life. They thought they werent paid initially but merchant services says they were once they reached out to them. Are they filling out disputes incorrectly? 

I am requesting written documentation on D XXXX including the merchants response. I dont need it on D XXXX because Citibank sent me a letter apologizing for the confusion. 

Please try to get this problem fixed. I have been trying to fix these problems for weeks and I am worn out. On another note, they burned another pizza. This time I took pictures and complained directly to them in writing. I am having to seek a refund through XXXX. I am so tired of this location screwing up and don't plan on dining at this location ever again. I have attached pictures of it so Citibank 's executive team can clearly see XXXX burns pizzas, even though it clearly isn't related to this dispute. XXXX should have never accused me of lying about the XXXX   dispute, saying I made no effort to say anything at the time about the pizza, I didn't seek a refund, and implied it wasn't burned. I think the only thing off on the dispute is probably that we dined in the restaurant. I must have been confused when I entered it in the dispute system. 

To be clear, when eating at XXXX, you can order through the line for dine-in or carry out. If there is a problem with the food, a customer tells the manager on duty and he or she can process the refund based on the receipt alone. Same if you complain over the phone. The refund just didn't get applied, period. XXXX  isn't the first restaurant to make this kind of mistake. We eat out all the time. We spend about {$1200.00} a month on dining out. We put nearly $ 46k in charges on the Citibank card last year ; we used it for everything. Mistakes happen at the restaurant level. All restaurant managers and owners will tell you that. Managers get busy, forget to apply the refunds in person and over the phone, and forget to send out gift certificates or promptly issue refunds all the time. Three instances that I have had in the last two weeks alone are XXXX XXXX, XXXX 's and XXXX. Now, I make sure I am getting everything in writing so problems like this never happen again.

05/13/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX respectively, two credit card charges were made by me on my Citibank Costco visa card for the amount of {$680.00} and {$200.00}. Due to COVID-19 and travel restrictions, multiple attempts were made to cancel the booking and obtain a refund. Both hotels agreed to not charge but XXXX was not responding to request for a refund, so credit card dispute was started. 
While the dispute was going on, on XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX agreed to refund both charges. Keeping that in mind I withdrew my dispute with my credit card, letting the charges for both amounts get posted on my account. 
I got the confirmation for cancellation from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for the same. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, I received multiple emails from XXXX that the refund was not processed and to call them. After the call, I was sent an email again saying the refund has been processed. This happened for both hotels. All this while the conditional credit was removed from my account and charges were made for XXXX. 
Both refund emails were sent to me again on XX/XX/XXXX for both the charges. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX sent another letter saying they can not issue the refund, provided me with a chargeback number, and requested I follow up with the bank. 
When I contacted Citibank, they said they can not do anything since I accepted this charge. 
I contacted the XXXX again and they said they had already dispensed XXXX for one the hotel booking and that this charge will have to deal with my bank. For the {$680.00} charge for another reservation, they would need a letter from the bank stating that they are no longer pursuing the dispute, for XXXX to refund. 

I have contacted them every day for the past two weeks and have been transferred from one department to another and have stayed as long as two hours on wait only to be disconnected and start all over again. 

Citibank is not cooperating and providing the service that they are supposed to, nor are they assisting in resolving this issue.

'' After quickly meeting the minimum spend requirement, I patiently waited for the XXXX ThankYou points to post to my account.

I was advised that I did not qualify for the XXXX points offer because I had opened an account in the last 24 months. 

While it is true that I opened up a new Citi Rewards+ card through a product conversion, no new cardmember bonus was received for this card.

02/01/20,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Banking errors,"A system error that Citibank had created for my accounts, please see my commentary below :.

A. Citibank sent me my end of the year Accounts Statement, said Bank Statement disclosed my various accounts, the accumulated or aggregated interest for the year, and said accumulated or aggregated interest amounts were incorrect, and I relied upon them for other purposes, which made me incorrect for those purposes.

B. Citibank also provided the 1099-INT form, and in that Statement they declared figures completely different from that which the end of the year statement did, by as much as {$430.00}.

Basically what it comes down to is that Citibank decided not to reflect the aggregate interest for all of my accounts on my Bank Statement, and then simply decided to recall those figures within the 1099-INT form, which in turn really damaged my reporting that outward to other entities inquiring. As such, I personally believe that every Bank Statement from Citibank should always be accurate to the very last line, otherwise what is a Banking Institution that you are entrusting your financial information and assets designed for? 

When I contacted Citibank Corporate and spoke to a management authority at a U.S. Citibank Corporate facility, said management authority stated the following : 1. XXXX XXXX, you should not have relied upon your bank statement! 
2. Mr. XXXX, the fact that your Bank Statement differs from the 1099-INT sometimes happens! 

All to say, the testimony above is simply unacceptable, especially since the individual at Citibank Corporate was subjective and arrogant about their assertions, and they ( the bank ) have done things like this on two separate occasions within the last several years.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,928XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/01/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3516498

Then he looked into my other card, and just said that he was gon na waive the late fees. I explained that my other credit card waive the payment for me, but he wouldn't do anything. I asked if my payment would double up since hes telling me I don't have to pay it and he couldn't give me a for sure answer.

02/12/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I am writing regarding the cardholder agreement Citibank has provided me through their website. 

About two weeks ago, I ordered my cardholder agreement through the website. The agreement they sent me is not Costco 's agreement, although the PDF document is clearly coded for Costco. Lists nothing about the Costco agreement, period, including rewards. I have addressed this problem in a prior CFPB complaint and Citibank has failed to properly address in in writing. So, I am filing an individual complaint about it. 

Initially, when I spoke to XXXX in the executive office on XXXX, I told her about the incorrect agreement. She then referred me to Costco 's website. Citibank should be providing customers with the right agreement when ordered. 

I then tried to order another Citibank agreement on their website and the link to order it disappeared. Then I noticed the cardholder agreement disappeared on their Notice 's and Letter 's page. 

On XXXX, I spoke to XXXX in the executive office. I informed him also that I don't have possession of the right agreement and he also referred me to Costco 's website. I again told him Citibank shouldn't be directing people to Costco 's website ; they should be providing customers with everything in the agreement, including outlines of rewards. 

On XXXX, called Citibank 800 number. I talked to to XXXX. I asked her for a copy of my cardmember agreement electronically and by mail. She stated it would appear in my Notice 's and Letter 's page within 24 hours. About 24 hours later, I received an e-mail stating there was a letter regarding the details of my pricing terms. I clicked on the link, logged in, and nothing was there. 

On XXXX, I talked to XXXX in customer service. I asked her for another agreement and the explained e-mail notifications and nothing showing up in Notices and Letters. XXXX said I have been the 2nd or 3rd person to complain to her in the last week and just thought it was just a dispute related problem. Apparently, dispute communication through Notices and Letters have been disappearing as well. She said I was the first person to alert her that it was also a cardholder agreement problem. I told XXXX that I was also having problems with older dispute notifications vanishing, although a few are still there. I have put in written requests for numerous disputes through billing disputes, and I assume they are manually entering the requests which is the only reason I have recent ones. XXXX said she would send it to me electronically again and would also send it by mail. I told her if it didn't appear again with the same e-mail that I would call them back and request another one electronically. 

On XXXX around XXXX XXXX, I spoke to XXXX in customer service. I asked for a copy of my cardholder agreement. I told him it wasn't coming through Notices and Letters. XXXX put me on hold and stated he was going to discuss it with his escalations team. He left me on hold for several minutes. He stated they had just sent it out ( I told him it still wasn't in Notices and Letters ) and he replied I would get it in 7 days. 

I am including screen prints of the Costco agreement, a PDF file of the agreement they provided on their website, screen prints of the Notices and Letters page 's that reflect it should show a 12-month history and it doesn't, as well as it showing there is no pricing agreement.

I received my card XX/XX/XXXX, activated it & completed the online enrollment process and immediately attempted to access my account through the mobile app. I was only able to login to the app once. I tried again a few hours later and I keep receiving the error message "" temporary delays ''. This has been going on for me for 2 days now, and Citi 's IT department was unable to resolve the issue. The best solution they could offer was to uninstall, reinstall the app, and if that did not work reboot my phone. 

I tried using the app on another XXXX phone and the same message is displayed. Out of curiosity I XXXX "" Citibank temporary delays '' to see if others were having this problem. It turns out this problem has existed for YEARS. As far as I can tell the "" temporary delays '' issue with the mobile app has been around since XXXX. So fast-forward 7 years later and it still persists. This prompted me to start reading reviews of their mobile app on the XXXX playstore, and I unearthed a treasure trove of complaints. The vast majority revolving around not being able to login to the app. People can't even pay their bills, or unlock their card. To put it simply, it is freaking XXXX and this is ridiculous. If a customer is late with their monthly payment, all XXXX breaks loose. So why is it okay for Citi to knowingly neglect and ignore this on-going issue? How can a billion dollar company, struggle with such a simple and core feature functionality? 

And ... since I'm here. Would someone please explain why Citi performed 2 hard inquiries on my account from the same credit bureau ( XXXX  )? I'm asking because when I pull my credit report, I can see my score drop by -3 points from the first inquiry ( XXXX ). Then a few days later, it dropped again by -3 points for the 2nd inquiry ( XXXX ). All for the same credit card ( Citi double cash ) that I'm writing about right now. Had I known their "" IT '' was this bad, I never would have applied for the card in the first place. 

Anyhow, I say all that to say this. Citi, you couldn't even keep me as a customer for a week. One week.

Citi, Citibank. 

My City Simplicity MC chargeback dispute and claims and defenses claims involved XXXX XXXX XXXX, owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Due to the way XXXX  billed me for its services and materials purchased, at this moment, invoices, charges, receipts are so intertwined that I am not sure I can show exactly what was charged for whatever. It is exhausting and frustrating. I am not an accountant. I am not sure what I owe compared to what has been charged to my Citi and XXXX XXXX credit cards. At a quick overview, I think I have been doubled billed and have over paid charges on my credit cards. In my opinion, XXXX XXXX record keeping is a mess. I have attached XXXX Invoices Estimates - Receipts. ( Attachment 1 ) Invoice Clarifications : There are no clear explanations for work completed, no specific list of materials used with cost amounts, no copies of merchant receipts on any of the documents/invoices provided by XXXX XXXX. 
Invoice # XXXX : Services Provided by XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Posted Date XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NC {$1800.00} My request for a specific invoice of {$1800.00} was not provided. XXXX XXXX has not listed the services and materials for the charge of {$1800.00}. Instead I received an email saying that a credit for {$1800.00} was applied to Invoice XXXX. ( Attachment 2- same as Attachment 11 in XXXX Attachment ) ) I did not authorize this transaction. I have no receipts with date, merchant, merchant address for products provided by XXXX XXXX. This invoice charge was deducted and punt towards an invoice to XXXX XXXX card without consulting me first. I did receive a paid receipt for the {$1800.00}. I do have an email by XXXX that states that {$1800.00} was deducted from the amount due on Invoice # XXXX. However, when I attempted to add the different amounts on Invoice # XXXX I could not get a total of {$1800.00}. XXXX XXXX received {$1800.00}. 

Invoice # XXXX does list the same work Install Exterior Door and Demo Wall as the Estimate # XXXX for {$1800.00}. Invoice # XXXX lists other services not related to the estimate. I was unable to find a combination of charges for {$1800.00} on Invoice # XXXX amount of {$2900.00}. Receipt {$0.00} Due for Invoice XXXX. 

Invoice # XXXX shows I paid {$2900.00}. This is not correct. I only paid {$1100.00}. XXXX XXXX received {$1100.00}. The amount of {$2900.00} minus {$1800.00} credit equals {$1100.00}. I never received a breakdown of how the {$1800.00} was used that left a balance of {$1100.00}. No merchant receipts. 

Invoices # s XXXX and XXXX and the Citi {$1800.00} receipt are all intertwined. The invoices # s XXXX and XXXX and the Citi Receipt do not clearly show what was charged to XXXX XXXX : - Invoice # XXXX is used for charges to XXXX XXXX and Citi Simplicity. 
The XXXX XXXX Invoice XXXX was originally {$3600.00} but a deduction of Invoice {$1500.00} paid by a Citi Simplicity card reduced it to {$2000.00}. This amount was paid to XXXX XXXX and is on my XXXX Statement on XX/XX/XXXX. 
- I received a 2nd billing for {$2000.00}. It appears this was sent through XXXX XXXX and includes XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
- Invoice XXXX {$2900.00} : I have never paid {$2900.00} to anyone. This invoice is related to the {$1800.00} deducted from {$2900.00} and was charged to my Citi Simplicity card. I did not authorize these changes to my credit cards. ( I still owe {$1800.00} ). {$2900.00} minus {$1800.00} equals {$1100.00}, the amount that was charged on XXXX XXXX and shows on my XXXX statement paid on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Invoice # XXXX {$4200.00} and XXXX # XXXX line item Flooring {$110.00} plus tax : XXXX XXXX has not provided all the information about the XXXX XXXX XXXX. He has not given the name of the merchant, the date purchased from the merchant, the address of the merchant, and how to contact the merchant.

I contacted XXXX, an online website that connects homeowners with local home improvement contractors. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, is one of the referred contractors. 

I have heard from XXXX. They are presently reviewing all the information I provided. 

I have attached : - Citi chargeback dispute email letters/correspondences - Claims and defenses email letters/correspondences - I have separated them by months.

The claim request is in Attachment 5 XXXX emails. 

An additional email letter with 3 attachments, Attachment XXXX # 4, was sent to XXXX XXXX, Executive Response Unit on XX/XX/XXXX informing the Executive Response Unit of communication with Citibank representatives. ( Attachment 11 ). Another email was sent to to XXXX XXXX, Executive Response Unit on XX/XX/XXXX requesting the Executive Response Unit to make corrections in the Citi Simplicity Card Current Balance. ( Attachment 12 ) If you need additional information, please let me know. 

Box 2 What would be a fair resolution to this issue? 

XXXX walked out on the job and did not satisfactorily finished the 3 projects. XXXX XXXX has chosen not to communicate with me or respond to my last email ( Attachment 13 same as Attachment 8 in XXXX Attachment ) In his ten pages chargeback disute response to Citi Bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) XXXX did not provide all the necessary information ( Attachment 14 ) : the first 2  pages are not legible, he did not comply with chargeback guidelines provided by XXXX XXXX and Master Card. 

Due to the sloppy workmanship and unfinished work, I am going to have to hire skilled, licensed workers to redo the jobs. This will be costly. Presently, I dont have the money to hire new workers. I am going to make calls and try to reputable licensed contractors.

03/11/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Re : CitiCard VISA complaint Citicard refused to dispute online fraud from XXXX & XXXX ( XXXX ). In a charge posted XX/XX/2019, it said they don't do "" quality control '' over rentals such as the one I'd reserved in XXXX, PR. To be clear, a receipt was provided for 700SF room and no one disputed it was switched for 200SF received. XXXX   disconnected 3 calls during my initial check in and then later argued I'd stayed, so there's nothing left to argue about. CITI knew I believed a pattern of fraud based on several reservations made, most were falsely advertised, but they refused to find fraud in that case. 
Now, another charge for rental in XXXX led to discovery of several specific misrepresentations that called for XXXX 's Book   with Confidence guaranty ( like XXXX, it claims that once their "" dedicated team '' gets in the loop, you're protected ), meaning they're obligated to investigate misrepresentations and relocate the victim of this kind of sophisticated fraud at their own cost. 
To be clear, my rental now was for XXXX through XXXX, but once inside we realized the fridge defect was known prior to our arrival yet undisclosed, airconditioning was admittedly misrepresented on review, bug infestations revealed issue, and dog nuisance was on premises and well known yet lied about to me during lead up to check in. So condoning lies as modus operandi at XXXX was means of nullifying my real time claim for Relocate on XXXX. Since then, it simply sends anonymous emails declining knowledge of anything wrong, ignores calls for administrative interaction, and sending surveys for its "" dedicated team '' as if that type response in his particular setting were not creepy So over {$980.00} inXX/XX/XXXX& {$2200.00} was charged where clear evidence of fraud from getgo was present and withheld even after disclosure of bad actors came out. But in both cases, the reservation agency after faking amenities present engaged on obvious lies to perpetuate the illusion that Relocation was not called for. How do we get an independent review of CITI 's resolution procedures to show its deliberate indifference toward crooked billing parties ( XXXX, XXXX )?

I was told these credits would be granted as a courtesy since my disputes were outside of the allotted 60 days period. I spoke to a total of 4 different Citi representatives in the dispute resolutions department and customer service, all of which assured me that I would receive this credit 'in 48 to 72 ' hours. Citibank 's automated system also confirmed that I was granted this credit. Every rep I spoke with confirmed this credit will be granted to my account ( Please listen to the recorded phone calls ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Citi again since no credits were posted, and I spoke to a supervisor named XXXX. She informed me that no credit would be granted. I explained to her that 4 different reps had informed me that I would be receiving this credit, and the automated system confirmed this as well. She then explained that my account was in review and that all my conversations with the Citi reps would be listened to, and I would receive a letter with the outcome. She said that it would be 7 to 10 business days from XX/XX/XXXX. I didnt receive a letter. 

I called Citi and spoke to XXXX on XXXX and she informed me that my account review was complete and I was approved for my credit of {$790.00} on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, and gave me confirmation # XXXX. She said that the department that handles the credits was closed due to COVID-19 and that I should get my credit later in the week. No credit has been seen. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I contact Citi again and spoke to XXXX. He tried to get a manager or supervisor on the line but he was unable since the call volume was very large. He said hed call me back with a resolution. He called me later that day and left me a voicemail that he had emailed that department and CCed his manager. He told me hed reach out with a resolution with in a day or so. I have heard nothing as of today, XX/XX/XXXX. 

I contacted Citi this morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ), and was put on hold for 50 minutes then the rep hung up. I called back and spoke to a lady. Was on hold with her for 1 hour and 37 minutes. She did check in with me and after about an hour, she said she would look into another solution to get my credit issue resolved. She hung up shortly after. 

I have been using Citibank exclusively for the past years, and I have NEVER in my entire credit card usage history experienced such blatant disregard.

It is my hope that by filing this complaint with CFPB that this complaint will finally reach someone at a leadership level within Citibank who will listen and to take the necessary action to reach my desired outcome. The outcome I am seeking is to continue with my refinance mortgage loan application that is currently in process with Citibank and still locked at a 3.25 % rate and actually receive the concession requested for the loan to be processed at zero origination points. This is the outcome I expected and was reassured by XXXX XXXX NMLS XXXX would happen during my conversation with him on XX/XX/XXXX when he convinced me to proceed with the loan application, run my credit report, and complete the loan application process. Furthermore, I received a reassuring email from XXXX XXXX in response to an email I sent asking for an update about the concessions to receive the loan at a 3.25 % rate with zero points. XXXX responded on XXXX at XXXX XXXX  stating I have not but the concession I have requested are coming back approved, So I am just in a waiting pattern right now. I have proof of all of my email communication with XXXX XXXX and a call log of dates at times including notes with all the other Citibank employees that I spoke with about the complaint from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/20. A summary of all events is listed below in this complaint. I am assuming that Citibank leadership can review all of the calls and email communications from their employees. I welcome these communications to become part of the documentation provided in response to this formal complaint with the CFPB. 

- On XX/XX/XXXX I called Citibank and began working with XXXX XXXX NMLS Identifier : XXXX to refinance an existing mortgage with Citibank. I explained to XXXX that I was shopping rates with a number of other lenders and wanted to know what Citibank had to offer for a 30-year fixed refinance mortgage for a jumbo loan. XXXX asked which banks I was talking to? I mentioned that I have a XXXX  XXXX XXXX account and have been a preferred XXXX XXXX XXXX client for approximately 20 years. XXXX said that Citibank does not like being beaten, especially by XXXX  XXXX XXXX. XXXX proceeded to take some information about my financial situation and quoted a rate of 3.25 %. XXXX informed me that he would have to run a credit check to verify my credit score to be eligible for the 3.25 % rate. I asked XXXX if there were any fees associated with the loan and he explained the application and appraisal fees. XXXX mentioned the 3.25 % rate had 1.5 points but he would put in for a concession to get the points waived. I asked what the likelihood was for getting a concession on the points because there was no need to run a credit report as I was not willing to pay 1.5 points in fees to get the loan as the payback period did not make financial sense to me. XXXX assured me that the chance was pretty good at getting the concession waived as all of his requests were coming back approved. Based on XXXX reassurance about Citibank waiving the fees for the points, I authorized him to run a credit report for me and my wife ( with her permission ). XXXX told me that he locked in the 3.25 % rate and I should have confirmation about the concession for Citibank to waive the points by Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX informed me that I would receive a welcome package from Citibank in the next day or two as the bank is required to send out the welcome package within 72 hours, but not be alarmed about any points that may be included on the documentation and not to sign the documents. XXXX said he would reach out and let me know when I would have the correct documents once he received the concession to waive the points. 

- I sent a follow-up email to XXXX XXXX on Monday XXXX at XXXX XXXX  to confirm if XXXX needed anything else from me and to let me know as soon as possible if Citibank approve his concession request. XXXX did not respond to my email request. 

- I sent a second follow-up email to XXXX XXXX on Tuesday XXXX at XXXX XXXX  to say that I was just reaching out to check on progress on getting the concession for zero points. I indicated that I needed to know ASAP because I did not want to miss another opportunity with a different bank as rates can change quickly. I stressed that I wanted to work with XXXX and Citibank if he could still offer the 3.25 % rate at zero points. I asked XXXX to please let me know as soon as he could if he was able to get the concession. I did not receive any email response or call from XXXX. 

- I sent another email to XXXX XXXX on Wednesday XXXX at XXXX XXXX   informing XXXX that I received the welcome package and consent to proceed emails from Citibank. I informed XXXX that I noticed the loan origination fees included 1.75 points. I let XXXX know that I was not going to sign these documents. I asked XXXX to let me know as soon as he could if I was going to receive revised documents with the 3.25 % rate at zero points to sign as he had previously advised me to wait to receive the corrected documents indicating the loan was for 3.25 % at zero points before signing anything. I did not receive any email response or call from XXXX. 

- I followed-up again on Wednesday XXXX at XXXX XXXX  with an email to XXXX XXXX. I emailed stating that I was just checking in to see if he had heard anything about the concession request. I did not receive a response, so I contacted Citibank and asked to speak to a manager so I could get an answer about the concession. The individual that I spoke with mentioned he would reach out to XXXX and have XXXX get back to me. XXXX responded later to my email on XXXX at XXXX XXXX  stating I have not but the concession I have requested are coming back approved, So I am just in a waiting pattern right now. 

- I followed up the following morning Thursday XXXX at XXXX XXXX  to confirm with XXXX XXXX that I should not sign any of the documents because I had received a reminder email Thursday XXXX morning to sign the documents to proceed with the loan and noticed the welcome package had the 3.25 % rate listed with fees including 1.75 points. I did not receive a response from XXXX. 

- I followed-up again via email on Friday XXXX at XXXX XXXX  to check with XXXX in as I did not receive a response to my email send on Thursday at XXXX XXXX. I stated in my email that I thought we would know about the concession by Thursday at the latest. I asked XXXX to let me know what the plan is. I did not receive a response to my email. 

- On Monday XXXX at XXXX XXXX I called Citibank loan processing at XXXX and asked for a manager. I explained to the loan processor who answered the phone that I was working with XXXX XXXX and that I was not getting any responses to my calls or emails. I had just tried to reach XXXX on the phone, but the call went to voicemail. I informed the loan processor that I was not comfortable continuing to wait as I was missing other opportunities to refinance my current mortgage with other banks, but wanted to remain with Citibank being that I have my current mortgage with Citibank and that I was already in the process with XXXX and had my credit checked. The loan processor assured me that I had locked in a very good rate and that Saturday XX/XX/XXXX was one of the best days in the past six months to refinance. He mentioned he would reach out to XXXX XXXX through internal means and have XXXX return my call. I did not document the loan processors name for this call because he convinced me that I was doing the right thing to wait for the concession and that XXXX was working on it. 

- On Monday XXXX at XXXX XXXX  CST XXXX XXXX emailed me the following : Hello ( my name ), I am on the phone, saw the missed call. Citibank did reject the concession request. I immediately called XXXX XXXX and my call again went to voicemail. I then emailed XXXX at XXXX XXXX  and asked him to call me at his next available opportunity. XXXX did not respond to my email or return my call. 

- On Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX I called Citibank loan processing and spoke with XXXX XXXX. I informed XXXX that I wanted to file a formal complaint with Citibank based on what had happened. I informed XXXX that I was expecting to receive a concession based on XXXX XXXX reassurance that his concession requests were coming back approved and that we were just in a waiting pattern. And, XXXX XXXX had not responded to me in a timely manner and I had trusted him and Citibank and based on that trust I had missed out on other opportunities to refinance my current mortgage at a lower interest rate and that this had cost me thousands of dollars. XXXX said she understood and Citibank would make things right for its customers. She proceeded to give me XXXX XXXX supervisors phone number and said she would reach out to XXXX XXXX and have XXXX call me back. I did not receive a call from XXXX XXXX. 

- I called Citibank on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  and spoke with XXXX XXXX. I explained the whole situation to XXXX and XXXX assured me Citibank would contact XXXX XXXX and have XXXX reach out to me. 

- I called Citibank on Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. I spoke to XXXX XXXX ( not sure of spelling of XXXX last name ). XXXX seemed appalled that this was happening, apologized and said she would file another internal complaint and escalate internally and include XXXX XXXX on copy of the complaint. XXXX provided me with XXXX XXXX direct phone number and email address. I was in meetings most of the day and did not have a chance to call XXXX. 

- On Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  I received an email from XXXX XXXX NMLS : XXXX stating that he called my number in the application but could not leave a message. Is there a time that is best to speak you? I did not see a missed call on my phone. 

- On Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  I called and spoke to XXXX XXXX. I explained the entire situation to XXXX. I expressed my dissatisfaction with the whole process. That I had trusted XXXX XXXX and Citibank to offer the loan which had been locked-in at 3.25 % with a concession request for zero points. I told XXXX that this was an unfair process given the fact that I had waited so long to receive a response that I had missed other opportunities to refinance at a lower rate with other banks. And, the fact that I had emailed XXXX XXXX multiple times ( documented in this complaint ) and called several time leaving voicemails about my concerns ( not all calls are documented in this complaint ) with no response until Monday XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX explained to me that the pricing team did not approve the concession. XXXX said the only way the pricing team would have approved a concession like the one requested was for me to provide written documentation from another lender proving the other lender was offering the same rate of 3.25 % at zero points. XXXX said this is the only way to have the pricing team match the 3.25 % at zero points. I told XXXX that XXXX never informed me that I was required to submit written offers from other banks to qualify for the 3.25 % rate at zero points. I asked XXXX if there was anything else that could be done to get the concession to waive the points. XXXX informed me that there was nothing else that could be done. I asked XXXX what the next steps were to escalate this within Citibank and to file another complaint. XXXX said he would escalate to the escalation team within Citibank and that someone from the escalation team would contact me within the next 24 hours. 

- On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  I received a call from XXXX XXXX from Citibanks escalation team. I explained the whole situation to XXXX and asked her to assist me with getting the 3.25 % rate at zero points. I told her that I had lost other opportunities to refinance at a lower rate than I have now on my current mortgage because other banks had raised their refinance rates already. I had called several banks on Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX and rates being quoted were markedly higher than those same banks were quoting on XX/XX/XXXX. I explained to her that so much time had passed from my initial application with Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX that I had missed other opportunities to refinance. XXXX said she would look into the matter, talk to both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX to understand what happened. I did not hear from XXXX again until Friday XX/XX/XXXX. 

- On Friday XX/XX/XXXX Lanore called me at XXXX XXXX  and informed me that she reviewed the issue with Citibank management and management had made a final decision and that while she admits there was delay in Citibank getting back to me there was nothing she could do to change managements decision to change the outcome of the concession request that XXXX XXXX submitted on my behalf. I asked XXXX to allow me to call her back because I was on another call at the time and that I did not agree with the outcome. 

- I attempted to call XXXX a few times before she called me back on Friday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. I reiterated my frustration about the entire process and that I did not agree with the decision to not offer me the 3.25 % rate at zero points. I told her it was unfair and not good business practice. I asked XXXX what my options were to escalate this complaint above her. She told me that the buck stops with her. She makes the final decision. I said I thought the issue was reviewed with Citibank management based on her previous call and management made the final decision not to honor the offer with concessions. I asked XXXX for the contact information for the person who made the final decision. XXXX said there was no person and that it was the pricing department. I told XXXX that departments dont make decisions and that people make decisions. I wanted the name and number of the person who has made the decision to do nothing about my complaint. XXXX told me that she made the decision and that the buck stops with her. I told XXXX that I highly doubt that she is the final decision maker and to please let me know who made the decision. She said the pricing department makes the decisions about whether or not to approve a concession request and that I would have had to provide documentation of another lenders offer for Citibanks pricing team to match the 3.25 % rate at zero points. I explained to XXXX as I had explained to XXXX XXXX that I was never requested to provide documentation proving another banks offer for a loan at 3.25 % with zero points. I continued to press XXXX and mentioned that to me it sounded like she just interviewed XXXX XXXX and was using his same response about the need to show proof that another bank was offering the 3.25 % rate at zero points. I expressed that my feeling was that XXXX did not review my complaint with any member of Citibank management like she claimed initially. XXXX repeatedly said that there was nothing I could do and there was no other person I could talk to within Citibank about my complaint. XXXX said she worked right under the Citibank President and had the final say. I asked XXXX what my alternative were and she informed me about the CFPB. XXXX said I could go on the CFPB website and file a complaint and the complaint would be routed to Executive Staff at Citibank. XXXX also stated that I could seek legal counsel to take legal action against Citibank.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NJ,None,None,Consent provided,Web,03/14/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3566610
05/18/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"I was notified by letter I received on XX/XX/XXXX that was dated XX/XX/XXXX that my AT & T Universal account that I have had since XX/XX/XXXX had been closed because it was inactive for more than 2 years. In fact the account was last used XX/XX/XXXX so it has not even been 2 years. 
I called that evening and asked it to be re-opened, and they said all I had to do was request it. I did that. 
Then I received two letters on XX/XX/XXXX. One was dated XX/XX/XXXX that the account could not be reopened as it was a joint account and then the second one dated XX/XX/XXXX that Citibank needed to access my credit information at XXXX which was blocked and that I needed to unblock it and call Citibank back when I did that. 
I contacted XXXX and unblocked my account and called Citbank back, but was told that it could not be re-opened anyway. I would have to reapply for a new card. I did some research and double checked the last time the card was used. Indeed it has been less than 2 years. 

I called again this evening and spoke with a representative who reiterated that the policy was a 25 month period of inactivity was grounds to close the account. I pointed out again it had been less than that, and he checked and verified that the last use was XX/XX/XXXX. Despite that he said now that the account was already closed, there was nothing he could do but I could reapply for a new card. I asked for a supervisor and XXXX ID XXXX also confirmed that 25 months of inactivity was the policy, but she couldn't do anything either because the account was already closed, and I would have to reapply for a current account because this was a "" grandfathered '' account they don't offer any more. It was the introductory offer when AT & T first offered the card. 

It is clear that Citibank violated their own policy, and the account closing was unjustified. Citibank seems to want to get rid of the old agreements in favor of new ones and will go to unfair lengths to do just that. It should be their responsibility to reinstate the account exactly as it was because it had not been a long enough period of inactivity. Additionally the notification of the closing was deficient as well because even a simple notice would have precluded all of this which is apparently their goal. The application of this inactivity criteria is unfair and deceptive, and was intentionally applied incorrectly to end a credit agreement. The reinstatement process is a sham as well requiring ineffective calls with long periods of silent holds to wear out the consumer. The call ends in asking me to reapply from the beginning for one of the newer products which seems to be their goal all along.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",AL,None,None,Consent provided,Web,05/19/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3658081

I could not find an email or online form ( why not? ), so it went out via USPS mail. 

I have taken advantage of multiple Citi USPS mail offers over the case of the last 2 years always reading the terms of these offers and ensuring that I remain within those terms. When applying for one of these offers I have provided 100 % accurate personal information and in most cases with my excellent credit score, have  been instantly approved for each card. On one occasion Citi did require me to call in to verify my identity ; easy and I was approved. For each card I met the spending requirement and was awarded the miles for that spend and the mandated bonus. So far so good. These have been XXXX XXXX branded cards. Interestingly, the offers stopped coming sometime in the summer of XXXX so that was the end of offers. So I thought. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX XXXX Corporate Security announcing that my account had been closed, my total of XXXX miles taken and I was no longer eligible to participate in their frequent flyer program again. And an upcoming flights had been instantly canceled. The letter seemed to be a form letter with clips from some terms included, but there never was an exact, explicit claim explaining what I had allegedly done. From reading online I gathered this was because of the Citi offers I had taken advantage of. Yet I complied with all of the terms of the mailer offers I received ( I went back and double checked ) and Citi approved me for each and every offer. The vague claims included fraud, misrepresentation and somehow exploiting something. Again, not clear at all what I have done to XXXX XXXX to warrant this action. 

So, yes, XXXX  was the actor that seems to have caused this issue. Yet my problem includes and was apparently caused by Citi. I can't say to what level Citi was involved, but the fact that XXXX XXXX has punished me for my interactions with Citi? I want to know what part Citi itself had in this scheme. If Citi is issuing XXXX XXXX credit cards and yet XXXX can decide to close accounts and delete the miles earned from these cards then there is something wrong. In fact, I see that Citi is still promoting XXXX   credit cards. I think anyone applying should be made well aware of what is going on. 

I have credit cards issues by Citi that are no longer valuable without an XXXX XXXX number, including a business card and I will need to close all of these if I can not get this issue resolved.

The item I was purchasing would be {$25.00} less. It showed me the amount it would cost me. The offer is still up on the computer at this time at Home Depot. 

I had trouble getting my personal phone verified to have the application accepted and had to speak with a CSR. I have a copy of a "" chat '' conversation with the CSR dated  XX/XX/20. I specifically asked when I would reieve the {$25.00} credit. In the "" chat '' I was told it would show up on my FIRST statement!!!! 

I have recieved my first statement and it is not included. I have called the credit card company and was told on XX/XX/20 the problem was resolved and I would find the {$25.00} credit on my FIRST statement dated in XXXX. 

On XX/XX/20 I received my FIRST statement dated XX/XX/20 with a payment due XX/XX/20. I did not have the {$25.00} credit. 

I have emailed the Credit Card company and received an email this morning that shows my balance WITHOUT the {$25.00} credit applied. I called the credit card company XXXX this morning. I was told that I might not receive the {$25.00} credit for one to two billing cycles. I was also told that if I did not pay the full amount owed on my  statement I WOULD ( not could ) be charged interest on the {$25.00} amount that I should have been credited. They told me I MUST pay the full amount to not have any interest charged. 

Can you imagine how many people applied for this credit card and are being charged interest on an amount they never should have owed? The offer is right now on the Home Depot site. The offer is for {$25.00}, {$50.00} or a {$100.00}. For each one of these amounts the credit card is expecting to charge interest on the amount of the offer for one or two billing cycles. 

This is a copy of my chat - I have taken away full names and used only initials. 

XXXX : The {$25.00} promotion credit will be applied on your first statement. 
XXXX : It is showing that I owe {$94.00} - this is the wrong amount! When I get my statement it will then show the {$25.00} credit? Is this what you are telling me? 
XXXX : Are you still there? 
XXXX : Yes, I am still here. It takes a moment for me to see your messages. 
XXXX : That is correct. If your total is {$94.00}, the {$25.00} will be applied on your first statement.

I am aware that your company has the ability/legal rights to report this debt to the credit bureaus as you deem necessary. Furthermore, you have the ability to change the listing since you are the information furnisher. Unfortunately, the negative item is factually accurate, reporting the negative mark was well within your right, even if it damages my credit standing. As granted by the fair debt collection practices act, I fulfilled my right to dispute this debt. Today, with the account being closed ; I see no other reason for your tradeline to remain on my file accept to maltreat. Not every merchant reports your credit activity the same way. Some lenders report to all three agencies ; some to just one. And because theres no legal obligation for merchants to report credit information, some never report your activity to any of them. Its completely voluntary. In addition, not every vendor do business on credit. For example, doctors dont typically report your payment activity to credit reporting agenciesunless they send your bill to a collection agency, at which point it will likely show up on your credit reports as an outstanding debt. There are laws, however, governing how your activity is reported. In 1970, the Fair Credit Reporting Act created a legal framework for credit reporting agencies and outlined the rights of consumers as wellincluding your right to a free copy of each of your three credit reports annually. Because credit reports can contain a lot of information, credit scores were developed to sum up the credit behavior reflected in credit reports with a convenient score. Above all, improving my overall credit worthiness is why I request a complete removal of your tradeline.

Link below to applicable regulation https : //www.consumerfinance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/regulations/1026/53/ # b The relevant credit card issuer is Citibank NA . 

I had balances in two different promotional offers on this credit card. As of the XX/XX/2020 statement, I had {$11000.00} balance against a 0.99 % APR offer expiring on XX/XX/2020, and {$4800.00} balance against a 0 % APR offer expiring on XX/XX/2020. I made a {$6000.00} payment to this credit card on XX/XX/2020 with the intention of clearing the balance that was scheduled for expiration on XX/XX/2020. However, upon receiving my XX/XX/2020 and XX/XX/2020 statements it became clear that the {$6000.00} payment was largely applied towards the other offer expiring on XX/XX/2020. This is in violation of the referenced CFPB regulation. As a result of this incorrect allocation, I had {$4400.00} balance transferred to Standard Purchases with corresponding interest rate of 18.19 %, and I'm starting to incur these high interest charges as of my XX/XX/2020 statement. 

I contacted Citibank NA customer service over the phone to resolve this issue. Their initial response was "" well, this is how we allocate payments ''. When i informed them that their allocation was in violation of federal regulations, I was told that this would be escalated to a supervisor who would call me back. I did not receive a call back for several weeks, upon which I made a follow up call and was told that the matter was still under investigation. Nothing happened for another week and then I received a letter from Citibank ( dated XX/XX/2020 ) stating that my request for payment allocation has been denied.

XX/XX/2020 I received a CITI email indicating that as of XX/XX/2020 my bill was past due. I have no idea why they didn't inform me on that day. I was charged a late fee and interest. 

3. XX/XX/2020 I did an electronic fund transfer to pay the bill in full. I called CITI to see why it had not been taken out automatically.

XX/XX/2020 I received another CITI email indicating that my bill was past due ( I checked online and it wasn't past due ). I called CITI again and they said that I was paid up and not to worry about it.

I have no way to know if these CITI emails represent planned harassment to discourage people form being late for payments or incompetent account management by CITI.

Today I receive an email that XXXX XXXX is shutting down my frequent flier account for "" exploitative practices ''. Literally the only practice I did was meet bonus requirements on credit cards that Citibank APPROVED me for. 

I don't think it is right that Citibank can offer bonuses and perks to third parties, via their credit cards, only to be shut down by the company for which the bonus was intended. 

Again Citibank APPROVED me for multiple credit cards, with bonus offers for meeting certain requirements. Requirements were met, bonus miles deposited into third party frequent flier account. Frequent flier account terminated today for "" exploitative practices '', when all I did was open credit cards that Citibank APPROVED me for. 

Is Citibank offering bonuses to third parties on credit cards, knowing that the consumer will have their relationship with the third party terminated for "" exploitative practices ''? Did Citibank KNOWINGLY APPROVE me for credit cards with bonuses that they knew I ultimately would not receive? Why approve me for multiple cards if the third party company does not want me to have multiple cards? What is going on here?

I now feel Macy 's is trying to 'bully me ' into paying more money for items I have already overpaid for. This account was settled last XXXX when I agreed to make a payment for additional interest of {$23.00}. Also, I have never received the {$43.00} credit that I have been due since XXXX that was erroneously applied to my original closed account, # XXXX. I have called & written Macy 's several times, with little to NO RESPONSE, only to become stressed with more billings showing added fees & interest to what is only fees & interest!. I have XXXX, not quite in survivor status & still taking medications to battle. Macy 's is making my XXXX more & more difficult to fight. And now there's Covid-19 to contend with! 
This was the issue : I never requested this American Express Macy 's Account, but in XX/XX/2019, I was told my original Macy 's card ( Account # XXXX ) was going to be phased out. A few weeks later, I returned an item charged on my original # XXXX account for {$43.00}. I purchased additional items totaling ( {$67.00} + {$47.00} = ) {$110.00} in Macy 's, but those items were charged to the Macy 's American Express account # XXXX. I attempted to pay these charges at the store in XX/XX/2019, but there was confusion about applying my credit from # XXXX to # XXXX. I requested to hear from Macy 's Customer Service by XX/XX/2019, as I knew I would be out of the country for several months. I did not hear from them. However, I was contacted by my mobile phone several times by 'Macy 's Representatives ' with no knowledge of the credit issuance yet demanding I pay several hundred dollars. These representatives were rude, called sometimes several times a day over the next several months yet none of the representatives could give me any details relating to the charges on my account. They just said I MUST PAY NOW! Every time I spoke to a Macy 's representative, I explained I could not access my account online. I requested an email copy of my statement ( s ). I was told NO, and, many times very rudely. No representative was willing to help me understand my charges, nor if I had received the {$43.00} credit. Every time they called, I requested to these phone representatives to close my account, as I did not know if my account had been compromised. None of the representatives would even let me know if there were additional purchases past XX/XX/2019. I requested supervisors, but I was never given one. I explained numerous times I was out of the country, & my internet connections were not secure. Also, I didn't have any pins or passwords for my new American Express Account, # XXXX. Finally, XX/XX/2019, I simply mailed a {$120.00} payment from Alaska, as I was sure that the purchases of mine were not more than that. 
I arrived back home in XX/XX/2019. I reviewed my paper statements, then I realized, I was never issued the {$43.00}. Additionally, I was being charged late fees, & interest, on these fees. Seems to be a vicious cycle. From my view, Macy 's had ( {$120.00} payment + $ XXXX.XXXXcredit due me = ) {$160.00} for the {$110.00} of merchandise. I contacted Macy 's Customer Service XXXX & XXXX (? ), then XXXX (? ). XXXX at XXXX on XX/XX/2019, helped me reach an agreement. After explaining the above, we agreed I would resolve this issue by paying an additional {$23.00} which he said was the interest on the account # XXXX at the time. In return, Macy 's would reduce the fees to what I had already paid & I would forgive the credit of {$43.00} due me since XX/XX/2019. I sent a money order for the {$23.00} on XXXX XXXX, 2019 to : MACY 'S, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, AZ XXXX My current bill is over {$400.00}!

When I submitted the requested phone records to Citi on XX/XX/2019 showing no calls were made to that business, I thought the dispute would be decided in my favor.

So fast forward to XXXX and now, after the next statement cycle came and went, Im told via chat messenger ( that I had to initiate ) that on XX/XX/XXXX I was credited the XXXX points! At this point Im just dumbfounded. 

Wanting further information I opted to wait until a weekday and on XX/XX/XXXX I contacted chat once more, and again this time I was credited with XXXX ThankYou points on XX/XX/XXXX for meeting the required terms and conditions of Promotion XXXX.

It clearly showed this on my XXXX statement. This then changed the following month. {$2500.00} was being charged 21.99 % and the remaining {$7000.00} was being charged at a rate of 7.99 %. The payment stated in the Citi Flex Loan was {$230.00} each month. Now I am paying approximately {$360.00} a month versus the {$230.00}.

During this visit I was given a treatment to demonstrate their product on my face. I was amazed at the results I saw, that I purchased the product at a cost of {$300.00} plus {$48.00} tax. 

Prior leaving the store, the salesperson again offered to demonstrate another product called XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). The machine used in the store definitely appeared to remove the wrinkles from my face. Based on these results, I purchased this product at a cost of {$5000.00} plus {$800.00} tax. 

When I arrived back at my hotel and unwrapped the packaging, I noticed that the {$300.00} product was for eyes only. This is not what was demonstrated in the store. After realizing I did not have the product that was demonstrated, I returned to the store to request the correct product. At this point I was told there were no refunds, which apparently also included exchanges, even though the error was on their end. 

Upon returning to the U.S., I made several unsuccessful attempts to contact the corporate office in New York. The product they are selling is a scam and does not work. While I was apparently a victim of their unethical practices and suckered into this purchase, there should be consumer recourse for their business practices and their fake products. 

As a result I am requesting a complete refund and/or the charges removed from my account in the amount of {$340.00} and {$5800.00} respectively. Your consideration in this matter will greatly appreciated.

I soon deposited approximately {$5000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX into the account. On XX/XX/XXXX I received another email update from Citibank about the offer and thanking me for enrolling in the Citibank {$200.00} checking offer and repeating the terms of the agreement. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX I utilized the Citibank Mobile Application 's chat function to inquire as to when my bonus might be depositing, as it had been well over 60 days since when I opened the account and deposited the qualifying funds on XX/XX/XXXX. 60 days since my deposit would have been around early XX/XX/XXXX. The Mobile Application representative stated they could not resolve the issue and to call their One Stop Sales Unit, which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative at the One Stop Sales Unit was confused and did not know how to search for the offer clearly, saying too that often the offers are for holding money in the account for 90 days or more, and provided essentially no clarity or guidance. 

I withdrew {$3000.00} of the {$5000.00} I had held in the account since XX/XX/XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, my first withdrawl from the account. I am concerned as Citibank has been very unclear on when my deposit bonus will be depositing, as that is {$5000.00} I could be storing in other accounts that actually provided material interest income ( which are generally well over 1.7 % at the moment compared to Citibank Basic Checking 's essential zero interest ).

The last time I attempted to call on XX/XX/2020 I demanded to not be transferred to this Macys recovery black hole where no one answers as it is completely unreasonable to wait over an hour and still not have an agent to speak to. The agent transferred me anyways - did not care at all about my problems or concerns and disregarded my request to speak with his supervisor. Is this normal for CITI customer service to not have steps to escalate phone calls and do the complete opposite of the customers request? This is unacceptable to treat customers this way - just pass them into this black hole queue and to not transfer my call to a supervisor when requested.

They will also often hold lesser charges to validate them but did not choose to do so in this case even though it was my first transaction with XXXX.

The balance is from a credit card account owned by my mother and we originally had my bank account information listed to take out payments ( not for payoff ). However - my mother wanted to payoff the entire amount & mistakenly requested that from the bank that was listed on the credit card account, which was mine at the time. 

It was attempted twice, so my mother called Citi Card Online to make the change. The representative told her that the ONLY thing she could do was to have myself make a stop payment on my bank account - so that the payment request would bounce back to Citi Card Online. Ultimately, this meant I had to pay the fees for a stop payment with my bank so that Citi Card Online could stop the withdrawal attempts for an account that is not owned by me at all just because we had my bank account listed for monthly payments to be made. 

I called Citi Card Online myself to file a complaint - the representative, as it should be with privacy, told me I was unable to access the account without the account holder present, but I just wanted to leave a complaint regarding this issue. The representative then informed me, over a recorded phone call, that a stop payment with my bank was unnecessary and that Citi Card Online could just as easily have changed the bank account information and stopped any future attempts to withdraw from the previous bank account. My mother was NOT told this and she was told the only recourse was that stop payment with my bank. I have now had to spend over {$110.00} ( {$58.00} was returned to me generously by my bank, for the overdraft fees - but they are unable to remove the third attempts fee ) for an account that would have been properly paid off had they just told my mother that she could change the banking information, instead of advising her that a stop payment should be made on the bank account that was on file.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,920XX,None,Consent provided,Web,01/08/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3489892

The dispute case number is XXXX. The reason for the dispute is the service received is not as expected. After I filed the dispute, the CITI dispute team never asked me to provide any supporting materials but closed the dispute in favor of the merchant by just listen to the merchant side. The reason CITI close the dispute is "" you used these services with the knowledge they were not what you originally agreed upon '', which is certainly not TRUE at all. 

The nature of this dispute is, when I book the hotel from CITI Thankyou portal 's travel website, the XXXX XXXX stated that their hotel room is SUPER CLEAN in their booking website. But when I stayed in the hotel, the room is not that clean and I get a severe bug bite in the hotel, and I know the consequence of bug bite after I leave the hotel. When I first stay in hotel I find the room is not that clean, but the hotel reject to refund the prepaid room charge, and promise they will clean the room to the required standard, but they didn't. First, I didn't know the room service I receive will be like this dirty, if I know I will never choose to stay there. No one is going to stay a room with bug issue. Second, hotel reject to refund the room charge after I tell them the issue of the room, and promise will clean the room, but they didn't. Thrid, the severe consequence of bug bite happens after I leave the hotel. So the reason that '' I understand the room situation at beginning and still choose to stay there '' is NOT TRUE. 

I called CITI dispute and explained what happened and CITI promised they will re-open the investigation. After I sent them all the supporting materials, the CITI dispute team never reach me to discuss the issue and reject the dispute for the same reason. I believe the CITI dispute team never investigate the case or even look at the supporting materials I sent to them.

03/10/20,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt is not yours,"XXXX XXXX XXXX DOB : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, TX XXXX XXXX ISSUES PRESENTED : First, Macys Guarantee to Not Hold me Accountable. I placed an order on Macys website ( ship-to-store, Macys, XXXX XXXX, TX ) and when I went to the store to pick it up, I lost my card. Another customer found my card ( which was taped to my order confirmation ), and without my authorization, used the print-out to pick up the order AND used the card to purchase a pair or shoes at the XXXX XXXX ( inside Macys ). I spoke personally to the manager at Macys, in XXXX XXXX, TX, and she guaranteed that I would be refunded and have a XXXX balance. Macys now refuses, on a corporate level, to honor this guarantee. 

Second, Macy has not provided written notice of the amount due, specifically : ( i ) charges for the online order ( which I never picked up ) ; ( ii ) charges for a pair of shoes I didnt purchase or authorize ; and ( iii ) late fees. My email address is : XXXX ; this is also my Macys account log-in. I have never received a statement from Macys at this email address. Additionally, my home mailing address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX. I have never received a paper statement, or notice of a late payment, at this mailing address. 

Third, improper notice on 2 fronts. I am represented by an attorney, XXXX XXXX XXXX, Attorney at Law, XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX. I informed the Store Manager at Macys in XXXX XXXX, TX of this circumstance, and the manager assured me that this would be duly noted and all correspondence would be directed to my lawyer. 

Fourth, Macys has knowingly reported incorrect information to the three ( 3 ) primary credit reporting agencies, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. Macys guaranteed that I would not be responsible for the charges and yet they continued to report to the 3 credit reporting agencies that I was delinquent.

Fifth, Macys reduced my credit limit without justification and without notice. 

Six, Macys did not issue cards when fraud was evident. 

FACTS : I placed an order on Macy 's website on XX/XX/XXXX : Order # XXXX, for Two ( 2 ) Sets of Colonial XXXX  Teaspoons, total cost : {$25.00} This order was placed online ; but it was a ship-to-store order, and the merchandise was required to be picked up at the Macys store in XXXX XXXX, TX. I printed the order confirmation  and taped by merchandise card to the order print-out. On Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX, I took the order print-out ( with the card still taped to it ) to the Macys Store in the XXXX XXXX, TX. I was accompanied by my XXXX XXXX son. Shortly after arriving, he had a tantrum that escalated into a full meltdown and we had to leave the store immediately. I accidentally laid down the print-out ( with merchandise card attached ). 

I returned to the store on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, when my son was in school, and I searched the store ; but, I couldn't find the print-out or card. I talked to the Store Manager ( Female, XXXX XXXX, who was extremely helpful and kind ). She looked up the order and said it had been picked up. She said she believed someone found my card in the store, taped to the order, and picked up the order. The manager said she  would "" take care of everything, '' and I would not be charged for the order. We did not discuss the purchase of the shoes at this time. 

Several months past and I didnt receive any further communication from Macys, i.e. I didnt receive statements, letters, late notices, etc., to either my email address ( XXXX ) or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX. My attorney, also, did not receive any information. Macys does not send a statement if there is no balance due ; therefore, I thought not balance was due. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I happened to sign on to my Macys online account and noticed that I had a balance which comprised of Order # XXXX, a purchase at XXXX XXXX XXXX ( for Shoes ) on XX/XX/XXXX, as well as several late fees and interest charges. I also noticed that my credit line was decreased to {$200.00} from {$600.00}. I immediately paid the balance and filed 2 online disputes on Macys website. I also called the Macys store in XXXX   XXXX, TX to speak to the manager ; but, she no longer works there. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a response from Macys indicating that they conducted an investigation and determined that I was responsible for Order # XXXX because the order was in-fact picked up in the store ; however, as mentioned above, I did not pick them up myself, another customer picked the order up without my authorization ( as discussed above ). Macys also indicated that I was responsible for the shoe purchase, because the card was present and the EMV chip was inserted ; however, the card was stolen at the time and the customer who used the card was not authorized to do so.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",TX,773XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/12/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3561481

I had not used the card for all of 2019, and had the {$95.00} annual fee post on the card on XX/XX/2019. I called Citi in late XXXX/XXXX  XXXX before it was due to have the annual fee taken off and the card downgraded to the fee-free ( AAdvantage MileUp ) version. 

When I spoke with the representative, they explained the change process, and understanding it would take some time, I specifically asked when the {$95.00} annual fee would be taken off. I know that sometimes it takes a couple billing cycles before an annual fee or other charge is removed, so I specifically asked do I have to pay the {$95.00}, or will it be taken off before it is a problem? I was told by the call center representative that the fee would be taken off ASAP, and t

hat I did not have to pay it or do anything further. Because of this, I obviously never paid the {$95.00}, having been told it was going to be removed before it affected me, and thus got a late mark on my credit report.

afford it, I only didnt pay because I was specifically told that I did not have to. The {$95.00} annual fee was the only charge on the card at the time ; there werent any other charges for the entire year of 2019.

02/12/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"Best Buy Credit Services, Citi Bank. Morally Bankrupt? 

First off, I think it is safe to say a {$60.00} fee on {$500.00} line of credit is outrageous. I think this fee is purposely more than the minimum payment so Citi can accrue interest on it by spreading the payment out over multiple months for customers enrolled in autopay. 

In XXXX I purchased a laptop on the CC to help with online classes I was taking at the time.I made several other purchases over a 6 month time frame. 

In XX/XX/XXXX I paid an annual fee and asked for the account to be closed, the customer service rep convinced me to keep the account open, as a favor she would reduce the amount I owed. To paraphrase, she explained it was in my best interest to keep the account open since the fee was taken care of. Understanding that closing a credit card could harm my credit, I enrolled in auto pay at that time. 

In XX/XX/XXXX an automatic payment was applied to the account for the XXXX annual fee but not for the total amount, I switched banks between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The next month the payment failed. 

I have another account with Citi that I was current on this entire time. 
I called in late XXXX to close the account and I thought this brought me to a XXXX balance but apparently I was mistaken. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX my credit report reflects the account is closed by the creditor. Late payment of over 90 days balance of {$150.00} that Citi forgave and did not send to a collection agency. 

As a result my credit score was dinged about 80 points from around 705 to XXXX Citi employee XXXX of Best Buy Credit Services team # XXXX denies that it was predatory to offer to reduce my balance if I would consider keeping the card open in XXXX. Citi also denies that a {$60.00} fee for a {$500.00} line of credit is predatory because I could have requested a credit line increase at any time.

05/26/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Application denied,"On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter informing me that my Citibank XXXX XXXX Mastercard account which I had maintained for the last 32 years was closed due to one or more late or returned payments within the past 6 months. Upon calling to bring my account current, I was informed that I can request a review to reopen the account and to keep all cash-rewards points Ive accumulated while having an active Citibank XXXX XXXX Mastercard. During the phone call, I provided all information required for this review. On XX/XX/XXXX, Ive received a letter from the bank with very little detail, stating that the bank was unable to reopen this account. Additionally, on XXXX XXXX XXXX  I received communication that all previously earned cash rewards were forfeited due to the account being closed. I had multiple conversations between these dates with Citibanks customer service supervisors to reopen the account and to reclaim my points, or just to reclaim my legally earned cashpoints. They can only make the request to the credit cards group and have that department make a determination. Apparently, there are no other individuals at Citibanks credit card business that I can interface with regarding my credit application. 

To summarize, in the middle of a national pandemic where almost 40 million Americans are jobless and 100 thousand deaths, Citibank, after a 32-year relationship, abruptly closed my only personal credit card and therefore forfeiting all earned cash rewards which is estimated to be {$2700.00}. In addition, Citibank unreasonable refused to review or reopen an account for a long-term customer who has an exceptional FICO score of over 800, and who has never missed a single payment prior to this technical error from their own system. 

It is my belief that during this pandemic and shut-down, many companies are short-staffed. Companies do not have the same manpower to fairly and accurately complete a thorough review. Simply rubber-stamping decline as per the companys policy does not accurately reflect the Heartfelt Thanks Memo sent by XXXX XXXX Citibank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX where he discussed understanding, flexibility, assistance, support as top priority and obligation. Regardless, during these unprecedented and challenging times, having my account reopened and reclaiming my cash rewards is vital for my family and for me as it is my only personal credit card. 

In this complaint, it is clear that Citibank has acted very unfairly to a consumer. At a minimum, customers who earned cash rewards or points through the use of credit cards should still be legally entitled to them for a stated period of time after the account has been closed either per customers request or by the institution. For a major US financial institution to unilaterally close a customers account for whatever reason then revoke all rewards earned without notice during a health crisis and soon-to-be a financial crisis is just unconscionable. I hope that this complaint against Citibank falls within the mission of the CFPB. I would like to thank the agency ahead of time and hope for a resolution shortly.

Upon my return to the United States in early XXXX, I found a number of urgent alerts from my credit monitoring company, XXXX. The alert messages made it immediately clear that I had been a victim of identity theft. I soon realized that my once perfect credit score had plummeted, all of my accounts that never had a late or missed payment were closed, and worst of all I no longer had access to my accounts as the person who committed the fraud changed all of the contact information. I immediately called to report the charges and any new fraudulent accounts to the appropriate banks. Getting access returned to me was nearly impossible. As of today, I have been able to restore the contact information with help from a Credit Bureau Dispute but still do not have access to statements and account status has been so restricted I can not even make payments for money that I might owe. I've made little progress since reporting the fraud. Three out of four banks have not restored my access to the account, all accounts remain closed, all accounts still have fraudulent charges and are accruing interest on the fraudulent charges. Collections agents have harassed and threatened me, and fraudulent charges have been added to my credit report. All of the banks have told me I am responsible for all of the fraud charges despite a police report that details what happened and the arrest of the individual who did it, letters from my attorney, and documentation showing I was out of the country. As of XX/XX/2019 all of these banks were still making contact with the fraudulent user even after I reported the fraud. I have been unable to get access to statements while the banks themselves were making calls to the wrong person. Fraudulent activity was reported in a timely manner and well within the time allotted by federal law. All of the notes on my accounts regarding the issue are no longer there, there is no record of the documentation I sent in to the banks despite my attorney receiving confirmation from mail carrier and tracking number that letters were signed off for upon delivery.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,117XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/14/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3567224

As a result, the card is set up for {$7200.00} per month to be sent from my bank to your bank for payment on the credit card. I was carrying a credit balance of {$2800.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and this credit was reversed, with a debit on XX/XX/XXXX with the reason given credit refund as requested. Several issues present themselves here. First, I did not request a credit refund. Second in over 22 years with Citi as a credit card customer Citi never did this on my account. When I signed on to chat XXXX responded and informed me that a check was being issued but it was being held because of a dispute with a merchant. The amounts in dispute, there are two of them, total {$120.00} and I will not belabor the lack of logic in the discrepancy of the amount held vs. the dispute nor the fact that this has never been the policy. XXXX continued to state that this was normal policy and I know it is not, at least not on my account for over 22 years. I believe that the funds have been misappropriated and that Citi is unable to provide a reason for either the difference or why, suddenly, the decision to remove a credit and cover it up by telling me it was as requested. I asked to speak with a supervisor but was advised to wait until one was available. I had simply asked for an email from a supervisor stating the policy and assuring me the check would in fact be processed.

06/10/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"I purchased a XXXX stove XX/XX/XXXX from a Sears outlet store located in XXXX, TX. in the amount My salesperson 's name was XXXX? At the time of the purchase I also purchased SEARS MASTER PROTECTION PLAN in the amount of {$290.00}, which was refundable if not used within a year. I began calling XX/XX/XXXX with a request to cancel the protection plan. I never made a claim on the stove, so the protection plan was fully refundable per the salesperson -- XXXX. When I first began calling the cancellation number, I was told I could not cancel the agreement as I was originally told by my salesman. XXXX put me in contact with a Mr. XXXX. This process began last year in XXXX. Several unsuccessful attempts were made -- -- or so I thought! 

Since I had a year to keep the plan without incurring any penalties if the plan was never used, I decided to keep it until closer to the one-year anniversary date. Therefore, I began calling again in XX/XX/XXXX because realizing the nearness of the deadline for the protection plan. To my surprise, when I finally did speak with someone in XXXX, I was told the protection plan had been cancelled on XX/XX/XXXX and "" you were issued a check '' I was told, to which I replied, I never received a check. No adjustment was ever made to my account as best I can tell! This was the beginning of several calls with various numbers. Here is a list of all the numbers I have been unsuccessfully calling over the past 3 months : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX -- -- all with EXTENDED wait times of more than 45 minutes with many of them!! One of the personnel gave me case number ( s ) : XXXX, XXXX and was told to ask for a Ms. XXXX @ XXXX. 
When I asked about the check that was supposedly issued to me, I was told several times that someone would research the check and get back with me -- -I have never received a return call from either of these numbers. I did not think that was a difficult problem since the check has a number that can easily be traced. Others gave me a time to call them back to get the status of the check, to which I did faithfully each time. To date, I am at square zero and it has been over a year since my initial contact with Sears. During the initial break out of Covid-19, the wait times were extremely long -- -more than an hour each time -- - due to lack of personnel. Each time I would make several calls in a day because I was always given different departments to call and I was desperate for a resolution! I have been extremely patient with them.

It was a 12-month interest-free credit card purchase which was to be paid in full XX/XX/XXXX. Because I have not been able to resolve this issue, I now have {$190.00} of interest added to my card along with the {$290.00} service protection fee that was never removed. My focus was on resolving the protection plan issue and I failed to pay down the principal on the stove resulting in default on the 12 month interest-free offer, which would have not been a problem at all ; but my focus was only on getting through this. My last statement was {$510.00} of which a {$32.00} payment was made on XX/XX/XXXX. I continue making payments until an equitable resolution because I do not want this reflected on my credit report. 
I have attempted several times to find out what the purchase amount was. I was told that they do not keep those records after a year, and I do not have the purchase agreement. The only thing I was able to get from them was the receipt number -- - # XXXX. To my knowledge, I probably owe another $ XXXX on the account.

I called Citibank and manually paid the bill on the XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to a Citibank representative at that time and explained that I had manually paid and that I had had some delays due to COVID.

Subsequently, they have tried to collect the same bill 3 times. Each time I call and each time they say they can do nothing about this. So far I have had to pay XXXX $ in NSF fees because after 2 weeks they are still trying to collect the same bill which has been clearly posted as paid.

I was told that the drying issue would be solved by using a drying agent like XXXX XXXX. She advised me she would send an appliance technician out for the drainage issue. 
A few days later an appliance technician showed up. He didn't bring in any tools or paperwork, just himself. He was alone. I explained the drainage and drying issues. He again said the drying issues would be solved by using a drying agent. He then explained that the heater in the dishwasher only heated the water nothing else. He then went outside and brought in an XXXX. He shows me the XXXX. I didn't read anything about the drying issue. He said we had to turn on the hot water supply before using the dishwasher. That would help the drying process. At that time there was standing water in the dishwasher. He pushed a couple of buttons and the dishwasher drained. My friend walked out of the other room and asked if the dishwasher was fixed. The technician replied nothing is wrong with the dishwasher. A few days later we used the dishwasher and it didn't drain. There were items in the dishwasher that were molded and there was standing water. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Home Depot and told them the dishwasher was defective and I wanted to return it. I was told by Home Depot it was not returnable and not their problem. 
I called XXXX and told them there was standing water in the dishwasher. I told them it had molded items in the dishwasher. I was asked for the serial number.

The manager apologized for the inconvenience and reassured me that I would receive my money. He said that because of the large amount and the fact that Citi was not used to refunding such a large amount of money, they had to do a full investigation and it would only take another two to three business days to receive my money. I asked the manager if I would receive my money by Monday, XX/XX/2020. The manager replied, "" You should receive it by Friday, XX/XX/2020. '' As of this date, XX/XX/2020, Citi continues to hold on to my money.

It so happens I applied although hesitant for a Best Buy Managed by Citi Bank. And within seconds I was literally told a decision will be mailed to you. I have the option to email my decision. I was so infuriated I made countless calls on Friday XX/XX/2020, minutes after. Calling the Credit Card Status was not an option as my Social Security was not recognized. I call Best Buy Customer Service, was transferred to a live person right away. Well, the individual blatantly told me my decision was not based on my Credit Score. But income. And I will receive a letter via mail. 
I stated that was discrimination because Im on XXXX. 

This morning XX/XX/2020 I receive a PDF without a Password. Attachment included. I call the number later on in the afternoon. Also Screenshot of all included. 
I explained to representative about the email without a password as the fact I was discriminated due to my income. 
She transfers me over to her Supervisor XXXX. This was all from my cell phone XXXX. 

She rarely let me talk. Talked over me and told me the reason for denial was because my rent was XXXX $ for and my income is close to XXXX $ per yr. Income was not enough. 
I said I applied for a Home Depot Card and was accepted. She replies! Yeah. And your rent income was not put in. If it were, it would have been denied. Im looking at your application right now. 
I stated, first off. I did not fill out the application at Home Depot. I told him ( The Associate who processed Application ) I paid XXXX . My son and I go half and half on bills.. 
I filled out the Best Buy Application va internet. Why would I lie? 
She said! Well. You do not make enough income for a credit card. This is a Federal Law That was signed by Obama. Anyone making XXXX or less should not be approved. Really? 

I told her. So explain to me this. I have a secure credit card~ a Home Depot Card.~ pay half water ~ light~ Cable ~ XXXX Prescription Insurance premium. Which I make payments on. 

She said! And the Home Depot would have been denied. It had XXXX income. There you go CFPB ... Youd think with XXXX income on rent you would get a credit card? 
No.. 
I tried calling Corporate Office Liason. But waited for close to two hours and hung up. Given to me by the screenshot with XXXX area code.

I immediately called the fraud department and discovered that 4 transactions totaling {$16000.00} ( in less than 15 minutes ) were made in XXXX. I informed them that I did not make any of the transactions and I was in XXXX XXXX, NY. I was assured that the charges will be removed. Soon afterwards, one of the charges was removed but three charges totaling {$13000.00} remained on my card. I made further phone calls and was assured the other charges will be removed after an investigation. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Citibank informing me that I am liable for the charges because my chip-enabled card was used for the transaction and I had stated that the card was in my possession. As I was sure I did not make the transactions, I immediately filed a police report and submitted a formal letter requesting an appeal the same day. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Citibank fraud department to find out the status of my appeal and was informed that the case was closed and I was still liable because "" my phone had made a call to activate the new card prior to the transactions ''. This was the first time I was made aware of the existence of a new card. I did not request, receive or activate a new card. The card in my possession was issued in XX/XX/XXXX and was not due to expire till XXXX. The Citibank representative informed me that the new card was activated by a phone call made from my cell phone. He stated that in less than an hour of card activation, {$16000.00} was charged to my card. My official XXXX phone log proves that I never made a call to activate the card. The logs also show that I was in XXXX, NY when I called returned a call from the fraud department within minutes of the fraudulent transaction. 

I was informed that I had one last chance to contest the charges by Citibank executive response unit. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a letter to the executive response unit, including an official XXXX call log that definitively proved I never made a call to activate any card, and that I was XXXX miles away from XXXX at the time of the fraudulent transactions. 

On a follow up phone call with Citibank today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I was  informed that my final appeal was again rejected. I was not given clarification on why it was rejected or on what further recourse I have. 

To summarize, fraudulent transactions were made with a replacement card I never requested or received. The card was supposedly activated by a phone call made from by phone even though my call log clearly shows that it wasn't me. The credit card was previously used only for recurrent transactions, yet within 45 minutes of a replacement card activation, {$16000.00} was charged to it.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,115XX,None,Consent provided,Web,01/10/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3492315

I have the card agreement for Citi and there is no forfeiture of rewards disclosure ( agreement attached ). Secondly, the card agreement states Citi may cancel my accounts for no reason or any reason, I asked for a formal reason from Citi as to why the accounts were closed and they did not state it was for no reason which I understand does fall under the card agreement parameters, instead they stated the cancellation for both accounts was simply due to me paying my balance via money order ( cancellation reason attached ) which is in violation of my rights as a consumer. All in all I belive its an unfair business practice for Citi to garnish a total of {$2100.00} in rewards that rightfully belong to me.

01/31/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"On XX/XX/XXXX, our Costco rewards card through Citibank was declined. We have a {$33000.00} credit line, carry about an $ 8k balance each month, and pay nearly {$3000.00} to $ XXXX monthly on the card. It has always been paid as agreed. We charged about $ 46k last year alone, because we use the card for everything in order to obtain the rewards check. 

I logged on to the account to find Citibank had closed the card. I called them and spoke to a customer service rep. He stated he didn't show the card as closed, to refresh my browser, to clear my cookies, and to log back on. It still showed the account closed. Then he stated he had read it incorrectly, Citibank had closed the account, and he could not relay the reason why. He stated we would receive a letter within two weeks. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Citibank stating the account was closed for misrepresenting disputes. It was closed on the same day as a problem with XXXX. I had sent merchandise back, applied for it to be credit to my credit card, but by mistake they issued a gift card. Because I had a previous problem with XXXX delivery service and had filed a XXXX report, they had issued a partial XXXX refund and I assumed the credit I was showing on my account was above and beyond for the hassle. Even in the order history, if I hovered over wheres my refund, it clearly states the refund would be applied to my bank account or credit card. At no time did Citibank ask for supporting documentation from me, which I clearly would have sent upon request because I have their e-mail address at XXXX. I have sent documentation there when requested in the past. I went ahead and sent all the documentation proactively along with an XXXX dispute over expedited shipping that wasnt received within the 1-3 day period. Those were the only two charges I could guess would have problems. In the past, unless Citibank reversed charges because a merchant had finally issued a credit ( or in one case with XXXX it was reversed because we overlooked mailing the package back ), all other disputed charges were always resolved in my favor. Here is how Citibanks dispute process has worked : I dispute the item. Then, Citibank issues me a notice stating they are issuing me a credit. About a week later, Citibank issues a conditional credit on the account. Then I wait about 60-90 days to determine if they need additional supporting documentation from me or if they have resolved it in my favor. This should all be trackable through my account history and e-mail history that Citibank generates. They should be sending out verification to merchants. If the merchant disagrees, then Citibank should ask for additional supporting documentation. If they dont ask me for the information, I assume the merchant has agreed with my dispute or never got around to responding to Citibank which is highly doubtful. No merchant is going to give up money without their side of the story. 

So, after receiving the letter, I called Citibank to complain. I asked to speak to a supervisor. Customer service stated they would transfer me to one in disputes. The person transferred me to XXXX. XXXX researched my history, placed me on hold, and stated she spoke to a supervisor. She stated the supervisor stated the account would be reopened if I could supply supporting documentation for the disputes in question. I told her I would supply documentation as requested but would keep the account closed due to how my account had been handled ( I request they close it at the customers request instead of showing it closed by them ). I also inquired about my cash rewards check of nearly {$1000.00}. I had read online Citibank was keeping checks if accounts were closed, which made no sense to me because it is not listed in the cardholder agreement. I ordered one through their website and will provide it for your records. She stated the check had been redeemed at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. I stated that made no sense because I received an e-mail stating the check would be issued during the next billing period of XX/XX/XXXX. When I continued to press, I heard a dial tone. She had hung up on me. This should be verifiable through Citibanks phone records and recording of phone calls. I filed complaints with the CFPB and the Washington attorneys general office to alert Costco to the problem. The Washington AG stated they would forward my complaint to your office but that I should also file my own complaint in case my complaint wasnt logged. 

Today, I spoke to an XXXX at Citibank through their executive support team. She stated I have a long history of misrepresenting disputes which isnt accurate and they should have been proactively getting my side of the story and asking for supporting documentation from me when problems were arising. She listed several examples : four charges from XXXX, a charge from XXXX XXXX in XXXX, and and charge from XXXX. She claimed these merchants stated I never approached them for refunds of complained about products or services. This isnt true. I have even gone as far to e-mail complaints to all of these merchants in the past and currently have e-mails in to them as well to find out exactly what is going on. Again, all of these were permanent credits by Citibank and resolved in my favor. They should have asked for supporting documentation if they thought the dispute was not legitimate. 

Instead, I was told by XXXX that because of the amounts disputed, Citibank just automatically charges them off. I was taken back. If they had a legitimate concern about the disputes in question, they should have reached out to me my US mail, by phone, or by e-mail. I have always been under the impression they are investigating my disputes due to conditional credits applied to the account that are eventually converted to permanent. 

During the conversation, XXXX stated they would not be issuing the rewards check because the cardholder agreement states they can keep it. I am including a copy of the cardholder agreement I was sent by US mail and also through their computer generated request for the agreement. She stated they would not be reopening the account despite what I was told on Monday, which I could care less, but it needs to be closed under my name. 

In the meantime, I have withdrawn the XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX disputes because I plan on taking those up with the merchant, despite being issued permanent records per the conversation with XXXX I have in e-mails to them and I am waiting on replies. Depending on the replies, I will file additional reports as needed. I am furious they would make this type of accusation. I have also proactively been contacting merchants on disputes I have submitted over the last 90 days to determine issues. I have withdrawn a couple of other disputes because the merchant acknowledged the problem and issued gift cards for the problem. I have followed up with Citibanks billing disputes department with the e-mail correspondence explaining why the dispute has been withdrawn despite the permanent credits, also stating they should be asking for supporting documentation at the time of question rather than letting them pile up. I personally keep documentation until I receive a message that the dispute is resolved. It is ridiculous to throw this on the customer after the fact due because they are inept or too lazy at gathering documentation during the dispute process. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have paid off $ XXXX of the balance with a transfer. Another {$1700.00} will be paid on XX/XX/XXXX. This will leave a balance of about {$700.00} to be paid off in the next two weeks.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",KS,660XX,None,Consent provided,Web,01/31/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3515252

I was to pay no interest on this purchase for 18 months as long as the balance was paid in full by XX/XX/XXXX. The total amount of deferred interest was {$250.00}. I have paid over the monthly payment amount each month since this purchase, yet only {$64.00} was applied to the promotional balance.

I called the credit card company on XX/XX/XXXX when I noticed I still had {$460.00} left on my promotional balance despite paying well over that amount in the last 18 months. I was told it was because I had regular purchases that accrue interest daily so my payments were applied to that first. I requested to speak to a manager and I was transferred to "" XXXX ''. I asked her to reapply the payments that I made since XX/XX/XXXX so they were applied to the promotional balance instead of my regular purchases and she refused to do so stating my promotion was ending that day. It had not ended and I was still in the promotional period but she just refused to help me. My regular purchase balance was never {$0.00} for the 18 month promotional period. Their practices are deceptive applying little to no amount of my payment to my promotional balance each month leaving me with a balloon payment and then REFUSING to help me when I called to resolve the issue. This is unfair practice. 

From XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I made {$1400.00} in payments and only {$64.00} was applied to this promotional balance and that was part of my payment in XX/XX/XXXX. I did have a promotional balance for {$320.00} where {$34.00} was applied to the month before the promotional balance ended and then I had to make a lump sum payment of {$280.00} to pay that off in XX/XX/XXXX. I paid almost DOUBLE both of my promotional balances and only {$98.00} was applied to them the month before they expired then I had a balloon payment due the month the promotion expired. Why is Best Buy inconsistent and applying only a PARTIAL amount of the payment to the promotional balance and only doing so the month before the promotion ends? What kind of deceptive and unfair practice is that? 

There is NO OPTION online to confirm how you want your payment applied. I was told that I would have to make the payment, wait for it to post, and then call them every month and have them reapply my payment. This is absurd not to mention I do not trust them to not mess up the accounting of my card when they reapply a payment each month. I am the consumer and the one making the payment. I should be deciding how it should be applied in MY best interest, not the interest of the company. There should be an option at the time you are making the payment where you can decide how you want it allocated. Many other companies do this and may other companies I use for various reasons. But why would they implement this when they are making more money off consumers the other way? They act like you have a period of time to pay off a promotional balance but they misallocate your payments so you have to pay one lump sum at the end anyway despite the payments you made all along. 

At the VERY LEAST, any amount over the accrued interest for that month should be automatically be applied to the promotional balance since that has an end date and regular purchases do not.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",PA,None,None,Consent provided,Web,05/13/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3650513

At the end of the chat, the agent told me ( I quote precisely from the conversation ), I have reversed the fees for you and it will be credited to your account in 24-48 hours. That did not happen. Had it happened, the two recent transactions of XX/XX/XXXX and 21, the ones about to generate NSF fees, would have been covered. Yesterday, when I discovered that the three charges my online Chat agent said would be reversed were not reversed, I started another online Chat but was directed to call Customer Service. After waiting for 1 1/2 hours on hold, I was finally connected to a Supervisor. I tried to explain to her the circumstances of my Chat, hoping to correct the fact that the fees were not yet reversed. I also pointed out that it was getting to be a situation I could not handle because of the loss of work due to the Coronavirus shutdown and my thinly stretched resources. I also let her know that I thought my situation was unfair because it seemed that fees were just creating more fees. We got into just one example, a {$34.00} overdraft fee assessed on XX/XX/XXXX, a fee caused by the Monthly Service Fee of {$12.00}. This is a fee that the bank offered to and did waive as part of their effort to be mindful of and helpful with customers at this time when many of us are facing economic hardship. Before I could even get into the total situation or figure out why the fees I was told were going to be reversed were not, the Supervisor said, No, no, we dont have to waive that fee for you even though it was caused by the fee that the bank is waiving. Her tone was appallingly rude, so I asked her for her name, which she said so quickly that I couldnt understand it. Then, just as quickly, she hung up on me. This made me a little suspicious. Why wouldnt she explain why my fees werent reversed as described? And, are banks legally allowed to generate fee charges from fee charges that are later reversed? 

I looked again through my ledger and noted a few things. The first Overdraft Fee in this chain was on XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00}. The bank reversed these fees on XX/XX/XXXX. This caused the account to become overdrawn by {$33.00}. If that money had been in the account, the next two NSF fees on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX for an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX payment of {$60.00} would not have been assessed because there would have been enough to cover the payment. ( These fees were paid when I deposited {$290.00} in the account on XX/XX/XXXX ). The next set of fees ( {$34.00} each ) comes on the XXXX and XXXX of XXXX for another XXXX XXXX XXXX paymen of {$60.00}. I had made the deposit of {$290.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, trying to make sure this was all covered, but it ended up not being enough because the {$34.00} NSF fee was assessed retroactively to that day, so I couldnt have known about it when I made the deposit. Then the last Overdraft fee appears XX/XX/XXXX, a fee that was, as stated above, caused by the monthly service charge, which itself was waived. Finally, there are the two charges about to be assessed. 

I must say, I was really hoping to have all these charges reversed because charges that were deemed reversible caused other charges to occur. In real time, I was trying to keep up with these charges by refuting them and having them reversed and even by depositing enough money to cover them. The situation of fees causing other fees has had a domino effect on the account that I simply will not be able to recover from at this time while we are all under lock-down. I still do not know why the charges that were going to be reversed were not. But all this has certainly worked to the banks advantage. In a month, they would be making off of me 22 times the monthly service charge! Besides thinking that there is something wrong with they way they are creating and assessing fees, I also found the Supervisor with whom I spoke uninterested in my issues to the point of being rude and obstructive as well as completely insensitive to anything happening to Americans as a result of the Coronavirus, this despite Citibanks posturing to act as though it is interested in being helpful.

Following 1 more week without any checks, I again went on their website and chose to print again, this time for 4 boxes. Again, it did not mention any costs. I submitted for printing to be done. 

This week I was sent 4 check boxes, and my account my charged {$100.00} without any prior indication of the costs.

After citing concerns about the card I was forwarded to a retention specialist, to see if they can give me offers which will have me keep the account/credit card open. When speaking with the retention specialist I was initially offered to spend {$99.00} in the next 30 days and I would then receive a {$99.00} statement credit. I told the agent that I am more interested in an offer which offers XXXX XXXX  miles instead. The agent then tells me there is another offer on my account where if I spend {$1000.00} in the next 90 days not only will I receive 2 AAdvantage miles per dollar, but also a XXXX AAdvantage mile bonus for the spend requirement. Thus my net total is XXXX AAdvantage Miles. I proceeded to tell the agent I am interested in this offer and she tells me that I can accept both. I verify the terms and conditions for both offers numerous times and she reads them back to me as verification. Once it is settled I thank her and end the call. Please note these calls are recorded and you can hear the recordings. 

I then call Citibank on XX/XX/2020 to verify and double check the two offers put on my credit card. Upon speaking with the agent I am told I only have one offer on my account which has been activated and that is the offer in which I get a {$99.00} statement credit when I spend {$99.00} within 30 days. I then told the retention specialist agent to please go back and listen to the phone call and transcript to verify what I was promised for me to keep the card. The agent states that she has filed a complaint and a report to listen to the phone call and transcript and for me to call back 24 to 48 hours later for a solution. 

I call Citibank back on XX/XX/2020 to follow up my phone call from XX/XX/XXXX.

She also then states that I can not change the offer from the {$99.00} statement credit to the bonus Aadvantage miles offer. I do not work for Citibank nor am I knowledgeable on their policies and procedures pertaining to offers. When the first agent that I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX offered me both offers she never once mentioned that if I accept one I am in eligible for the other, to the contrary she stated that I am eligible for both offers and that both offers have been added to my account. The retention specialist supervisor repeatedly tells me that I can not get both offers nor can I switch the offer now for the Aadvantage miles. She acknowledges that I was given misinformation by her representative on XX/XX/XXXX. She continues to reiterate that I already accepted one offer so they can not give me another, however I was unaware of this information and had I known this was the case I would have initially just accepted the offer for the XXXX XXXX AAdvantage miles.

I am asserting my rights under the federal and state Fair Debt Collection Practices Acts and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, including these rights : Because I have disputed this debt in writing within 30 days of receipt of your initial notice, you must obtain verification of the debt or a copy of the judgment against me and mail these items to me at your expense. You can not add interest or fees except those allowed by the original contract or state law. Any attempt to collect this debt without validating it violates the FDCPA. Also be advised that I am keeping accurate records of all correspondence from you and your company, including recording all phone calls, and I will not hesitate to report violations of the law to my State Attorney General, the Federal Trade Commission and the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have disputed this debt. Therefore, until it is validated, your information concerning this debt is assumed to be inaccurate. Accordingly, if you have already reported this debt to any credit-reporting agency ( CRA ) or Credit Bureau ( CB ), then you must immediately inform them of my dispute with this debt. Reporting information that you know to be inaccurate or failing to report information correctly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act 1681s-2. Should you pursue a judgment without validating this debt, I will inform the judge and request that the case be dismissed based on your failure to comply with the FDCPA. Finally, if you do not own this debt, I demand that you immediately send a copy of this dispute letter to the original creditor, so they are also aware that I dispute the debt. 
Furthermore, reporting information that you know to be inaccurate or failing to report information correctly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act. If your offices have reported invalidated information to any credit reporting agency, said action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",PA,191XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/02/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3551190
05/15/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I booked a XXXX flight through my Citi Premier Card using XXXX XXXX points worth {$800.00} as well as a credit of {$57.00} for a total ticket cost of {$850.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email stating that my flight was canceled due to the COVID-19 situation. Subsequently, I called Citi to obtain a refund of my points spent. Over the course of the next 4 weeks, I placed over 15 calls trying to get in contact with the company to find recourse for my situation. I spent over 16 hours on the phone trying to get this resolved as recorded in my phone records. I was transferred  between multiple departments from customer service, the XXXX points team, and speaking with supervisors. 

Ultimately, I was informed directly that Citi is opting to follow XXXX XXXX 's self-determined policy of providing airline credit rather than the U.S. Department of Transportation guidelines requiring airlines to provide full cash refunds on canceled flights. I am referring to the DoT Enforcement Notice released on XX/XX/XXXX stating "" in the context of the XXXX Novel Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) public health emergency, that U.S. and foreign airlines remain obligated to provide a prompt refund to passengers for flights to, within, or from the United States when the carrier cancels the passengers scheduled flight or makes a significant schedule change and the passenger chooses not to accept the alternative offered by the carrier ''. The notice is listed at this address : https : XXXX ). Again, the agent I spoke with stated clearly that Citi is opting to follow a company 's guidelines over that of the U.S. DoT. 

They are now unwilling to refund the XXXX points worth {$800.00} for my ticket and are instead offering flight credit to be used in two years, which is against the DoT guidelines for cancellations. They have however, temporarily provided a {$57.00} credit to my account to cover the non-point portion of my ticket purchase. There action is illegal and unacceptable. Furthermore, I will not be expecting to have the time to actually use this flight credit over the next two years during my medical residency. I am hoping that the CFPB can help resolve this issue and ensure that Citi follows clearly stated government laws.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MA,None,None,Consent provided,Web,05/15/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3654014

04/12/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"Headnote : I wish to emphasize at the outset that I am submitting a formal complaint to CFPB because Citi has not addressed my specific complaint at all in their replies to the submissions I have made directly to them. They instead change the subject stated in my complaint, while evading my actual complaint. Through this headnote I wish to put Citi on notice that a reply that fails to respond meaningfully to my actual complaint is simply non-responsive, and hereby request that CFPB consider it so. 

Executive Summary : As explained further in the sections below, Citi undermined my dispute with a merchant by deliberately filing that dispute with MasterCard  ( or MasterCard  's designated decider ) too late, even though warned by me in my original statement of dispute that they needed to file the dispute quickly in order to meet MasterCard  's deadline of 120 days from the date of the original transaction, i.e. by XX/XX/XXXX. 

As an analogy, this deadline is comparable to a statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit. No matter how strong the merits of your case, if you file it after the deadline, the court will not accept it. Accordingly, the subject of my complaint is Citi 's mishandling of the dispute that I had originally submitted to them, which Citi did not file until long after the deadline had passed. Citi 's failure to file the dispute in a timely manner pre-ordained a negative result. 

Background : On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, a dispute arose with a merchant in regard to a transaction made on XX/XX/XXXX using my Citi MasterCard. On XX/XX/XXXX, I overnighted a detailed statement of this dispute ( see Exhibit 1 ) to Citi, which was received the following morning, requesting that they file a chargeback with MasterCard. Based upon my research in the MasterCard Chargeback Guide, I provided Citi with the specific chargeback applicable to this situation under MasterCard rules, explained in detail how my dispute satisfied the requirements for that chargeback, and appended the pages from the MasterCard Chargeback Guide that cover the applicable chargeback. The statement heavily emphasized that, under MasterCard rules, the chargeback might have to be filed by XX/XX/XXXX which was 120 days after the transaction date. 

The Present Complaint : As recounted in my letter to Citi dated XX/XX/XXXX ( see Exhibit 2, p. 7-9 ), Citi promptly processed my statement of dispute, crediting my account for the disputed amount ( {$2900.00} ) on XX/XX/XXXX. Citi did file the specific chargeback that I had suggested ( as described in the previous section ) with MasterCard or MasterCard 's designated decider, a company called XXXX, XXXX. However Citi did not do so in the timely manner urged in my statement of dispute and required by the MasterCard Chargeback Guidelines with which Citi is obligated to comply. Instead, Citi waited 20 days to file, until long after the deadline I had warned them about had passed. XXXX XXXX  decision letter ( see Exhibit 2, p. 2-6 ) rejected the chargeback as "" Invalid Chargeback '' / "" Late dispute '' and explained that they received the chargeback from Citi 134 days after the transaction date ( on XX/XX/XXXX ), whereas according to the excerpts from the MasterCard Chargeback Guidelines that I had sent to Citi, the applicable chargeback can not be made more than 120 days after the transaction date. Thus the 120 day deadline was the deciding factor. 

Citi made it inevitable that the chargeback would be rejected by filing it with MasterCard/XXXX too late. On the basis of that rejection, Citi subsequently reversed the credit for the disputed transaction ( in the amount of {$2900.00} ) that it had initially applied to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. Citi 's letter of XX/XX/XXXX ( see Exhibit 2, p. 1-6 ) notified me of the rejection and the reversal of the credit to my account, and also contained the decision letter from XXXX noted above. The letter requested that if I "" still wish to dispute this charge, please specifically address the merchant 's response along with complete details of your dispute. '' My letter to Citi dated XX/XX/XXXX complained about Citi 's mishandling of the chargeback, pointing out that the chargeback Citi filed on my behalf was invalid on its face because Citi filed it too late, which made the information Citi requested about the original dispute irrelevant at that point. It was too late to resolve the original dispute with the merchant through MasterCard 's dispute resolution process because Cit had missed the applicable filing deadline. On XX/XX/XXXX ( see Exhibit 2, p. 10 ) Citi wrote to me announcing that they considered their investigation into my dispute to be complete because I had not specifically addressed the merchant 's response to the dispute, as requested in their letter of XX/XX/XXXX. This letter completely evaded the real issue which ( as stated in my XX/XX/XXXX letter ) was that Citi was responsible for the disputed amount because they had deliberately missed the deadline for filing the applicable chargeback with MasterCard. No additional information about the original dispute, however damning, could change that fact. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX I called Citi customer service, explaining that the reason stated in Citi 's XX/XX/XXXX letter for terminating the dispute was unresponsive to my XX/XX/XXXX letter to Citi. Any additional information concerning the merchant 's egregious conduct would be pointless, since it would not supersede the deadline of 120 days which Citi had deliberately failed to meet. I pointed out that it was no longer a dispute between myself and the merchant because of Cit 's deliberate delay in filing the chargeback with the relevant MasterCard authority, but had now become a dispute between Citi and myself. As a result of this call to customer service, Citi reopened my dispute. 

Citi then sent me a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ( see Exhibit 2, p.11 ) that simply reiterated the fact that the window of opportunity for resolving the original dispute had closed, stating "" We no longer have any recourse to obtain credit for you since the timeframe, in which to resolve a dispute has passed. '' Citi 's letter did not address their mishandling of the original dispute, which was the entire point of my XX/XX/XXXX letter. Citi was again evading the real issue by falling back upon the original dispute resolution process even though the window of opportunity for pursuing that process had closed almost 3 months earlier on XX/XX/XXXX, the critical date that I had warned them about in my XX/XX/XXXX statement of dispute. 

Since Citi knowingly submitted the chargeback to MasterCard/XXXX 2 weeks after the XX/XX/XXXX deadline, thus dooming it from the start, Citi is responsible for MasterCard/XXXX XXXX  rejection of the chargeback. Citi has not addressed their mishandling of the chargeback in any of their communications with me. Accordingly, Citi 's late filing of the chargeback, 20 days after receiving my statement of the merchant dispute, is the subject of the present complaint.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",PA,191XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,04/12/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3603423

03/30/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I am writing to you to dispute this charge. On XX/XX/XXXX, I went on a website called XXXX and purchase a supposed XXXX jersey for my husband. I checked out the website and they had a XXXX XXXX, California address so I felt comfortable making this purchase. Immediately after I made the purchase, I received an email confirmation from XXXX for a purchase from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Right then, my alarm bells went off? Who is this person? I purchased a jersey from XXXX  XXXX. I began XXXX the companys website and multiple sites came up saying that this was a scam. Embarrassed, I prayed I was wrong and the item be real and arrive. 
A few days later, I received an email with a tracking link and I began tracking it. The shipment was stalled for weeks. On XX/XX/XXXX, I wrote the company and requested an update. They responded with a tracking link from yet another company name, XXXX XXXX. I was puzzled as to what was happening. I XXXX  XXXX  XXXX only to find they had taken down the website. I began to panic. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed the package had arrived in New York. I again emailed the company and was told it would reach me soon. When the item did arrive on XX/XX/XXXX, I opened it and began to cry. It was 100 % counterfeit. ( please see attached photo ). The yellow lining was multiple different colors, the XXXX logo on the collar was fake and it looked as fake as possible. I immediately emailed the company and notified them that the item looks fake and requested a refund. I have never heard back. 
Immediately, I filed a dispute with Citi Bank. I have attached my email logs, XXXX receipt, my initial email confirmation from XXXX  XXXX  and a photo of the jersey. If you look for the companys website XXXX  XXXX, it does not exist. This company is a fraud and they scammed me. Please do not let a confirmation receipt on their part suffice as evidence as they have used multiple email accounts, the website no longer exists, many people online have complained about being scammed and they produced a counterfeit item which is illegal. Finally, these people ripped off people during the holidays. I am a hard working mom who was buying a XXXX present for my husband. It is sad and upsetting. 

In XXXX, I filed a complaint with Citibank. I was asked to submit documentation to demonstrate that the jersey was counterfeit and the company was a fraud, which I did. 
I received a letter from Citibank dismissing my dispute. I called and complained. On XX/XX/XXXX, a Citibank representative told me he spoke with his supervisor and would credit my account {$40.00} to make up for the fraud charge. As upset as I was not to receive the entire amount, I accepted. I was told I would receive the credit within 72 hours. After 72 hours had passed, I checked my account and saw I was not credited the funds. I contact Citibank via online chat ( photo attached ) and was told "" not to worry '' the Monday would be there shortly. Again, I never received the credit. I again contact Citibank via online chat and was again told they would inform their superiors via email of the pending credit and should receive it. Again, I never did. After waiting twice for two hour hold time and then being disconnected due to long wait time, I finally poke with someone who told me they would file a fraud charge on the card and it would be escalated for review. At that time, the representative changed my card number.I received a letter rejecting the dispute claim before I have even received my new card. It is like no one is actually reviewing my documentation of the fraud! To date, I am let angry and frustrated with the handling of this fraud by Citibank. I have not had my dispute taken seriously or receive the {$40.00} credit as promised.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,926XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/30/20,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3586068
04/03/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"Somewhere in mid XXXX ( cant remember the specific date ) {$0.00} So I had couple items returned and got a refund back into Citibank credit card. 
At that time, I had other card as a primary use so often forgot to use the credit I had on Citibank card. 
Slowly but surely I used most of the refunded amount on credit card but had left {$0.00}. 
I was sure that I am going to use it because it was my money that I already paid off to Citibank. But when I checked after my long trip, the money was gone. The balance was XXXX. 
I called Citibank customer service and asked the representative to explain why it happened. She said that if I dont use refund in 3months without a claim, they remove the money from my account because of inactivity. But I was using my card ( definitely a sign of activity ) and I didnt see anywhere saying that making a claim was part of protecting my money from the bank. I kept asked her who keeps the money after they put it aside, she was a bit hesitant to admit that it goes to Citibanks account. But I was persistent to hear that from her and she finally admitted that Citibank keeps the money after few minutes of going back and forth. And she got tired of me asking same question ( for me to comprehend why and how it happened ), she said, with her agitated voice, if I want my {$0.00} back to my credit card. 

I think the principle here is wrong to take peoples money without any notification or our acknowledgment that the credit card company has a right to take the money away, simply because it was claimed before 3months. The amount I lost is insignificant so I didnt think it should be a big deal but think of elderly or younger people who arent experienced with credit cards. Some people might feel lost or used and dont know where to ask for help or how to get their money back. 
Let me know if theres any policy indicating about non-claim money or requirement to claim on refund before 3months from the day of refund.

( 1 ) XXXX at XXXX XXXX  after adding the card to XXXX XXXX  upon activation of replacement cards. 
( 2 ) XXXX XXXX XXXX  after adding the card to XXXX XXXX [ Interacted via phone call on XXXX XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  ] ( 3 ) XXXX at XXXX XXXX  after adding the card to XXXX and XXXX XXXX on devices or accounts that have already been verified by previous representative, though it is expected that most users who receive their new replacement card ( s ) add the new numbers to previously added accounts and merchants. [ Interacted via phone call on XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  ] ( 4 ) After COMPLAINTANT successfully made transactions and locked/unlocked the card on XXXX at XXXX XXXX. 
Representative initially resisted unlocking the card by claiming that it needs have the verification letter be read by the COMPLAINTANT to verify him. However, COMPLAINTANT pointed out that "" if Citi can verify the COMPLAINTANT using the verification letter using the same mailbox ( as Citi faces same risk of wrongly verifying the true identity of the recipient of its letters/cards either way ), it also should easily be able to fix the issue by sending new replacement cards to the same mailbox. '' Each time COMPLAINTANT pointed out this strangeness, Citi employees have unlocked the account, just to restrict it again later on. It is questionable whether the true intent of these lock/restrict activities on Citi 's part is the truly guard the validity of the transactions or to frustrate COMPLAINTANT 's user the credit card. COMPLAINTANT also has other accounts with Citi, however, Citi selectively chooses to allow the other card to be used as a verification method while encouraging the COMPLAINTANT to put all his credit card accounts in to online mobile banking accounts, which would make it easier for Citi to lock COMPLAINTANT 's entire portfolio of Citi accounts, should Citi employees choose to manually intervene yet again. ( Since locking the mobile account for usage of one credit card would lock all accounts, as opposed to keeping those separate to prevent the restriction of one account from affecting the other ). 
[ On XXXX at XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  ] When confronted as to why Citi has shifting reasons behind being unable to properly verify the COMPLAINTANT, Citi indicated that it can't reuse verification methods that have been used by previous representatives. It is baffling that further interactions regarding the card could have been prevented had previous representatives who exhausted verification methods successfully unlock the account, but rather leave it locked in order to have the next representative use it as an excuse to keep COMPLAINTANT 's account blocked.

Closest guess COMPLAINTANT has at this point is that Citi is attempting to block or restrict accounts that have additional authorized users that can obscure Citi employees ' way of tracking COMPLAINTANT 's movement and spending habits. By forcing COMPLAINTANT to be the only authorized user on the account, Citi can more easily trace the COMPLAINTANT and his activtiies. ( By constantly causing dispute/restriction issues, Citi maybe trying to justify future inquiries as part of a regular or ordinary routine. However it keeps failing to apply the same procedure or criteria against all other users as well as failing to have call/text/email/case records that would support its claim of carrying out ordinary procedures ).",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,950XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/12/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3603365

I have been going through a nightmare since I made order from Best Buy online. 
I ordered an All in One PC - For {$1600.00} including tax My order was for a Black PC however and because it was an open box order, the PC I received was not the right one and was even different color ( White ). That is why I took it back to Best Buy store in XXXX at XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX New York. 
I went to customer service at the store and asked the agent if I can return the PC here or shall I mail it back as I received the wrong order and Its not the one I wanted. I was informed that I could return it in the store. 
He checked the PC to make sure all parts wer there. He turned it on to make sure it was working and asked if we have any personal data there, I said no. Then he took the PC and did the return and we got a return receipt. Then we have got the refund our Best Buy credit card. Also, we paid the credit card balance as we did order also a hard drive with the PC in the same online order but this we kept as there was nothing wrong with it. 
The Hard Drive was pickup at the store ( No problem was with that ) The PC was delivery to home ( This is the one we return ) {$1600.00} All was okay till after few weeks we saw new charges with the same amount of {$1600.00} to our card with no idea from where this charge came from and with no authorization from us. 
We contact Best Buy customer support to ask why this charge is in our account. They said we dont know as we see no problem here and advised to call the bank to cancel the changes as might be posted by mistake. 
We contacted Citi Bank and they asked us contact Best Buy and we have been between them going back and forth. We submitted a dispute for the charges as we were advised by Best Buy since this charge was a mistake. 
We did and the bank said we must wait from 4 to 6 weeks to get back to us by letter in the mail. We waited and got letter that we are responsible of the payment based on the evidence came with letter, and this evidence was just our online order invoice and delivery confirmation, nothing else about the new charges. 
We contact Citi Bank again and asked them how did this happen as we already returned this PC and we have a return receipt with us and we received refund for it already. They did not send us anything to clear the new charge. 
They said please fax or mail us the return receipt in order to reopen the dispute and they was so sorry about it ; however I did fax it and they reopen the dispute and asked us to wait another 4 to 6 weeks. 
We were so upset me and my husband but we had no choice and we was thinking this is the end of this issue. 
However, after waiting for a long time again they came back with same letter saying that we are responsible of the payment. We called to bank again as they didnt send us why this happen again. 
They however said on the phone that when Best Buy opened the box, the PC you returned was not the same as the one ordered, ( even they didnt mention this in the letter they sent us at all and we had to call them to know that ). This is the reason we returned the computer in the first place as it was not the right one. 
So we said yes therefore we return the PC because its not the same, its even showing on the return receipt under the reason of return that its not the one we wanted. 
So Best Buy took the PC from us and still charged us, how you even allow that? 
They said they would reopen the dispute and we had to wait for another 4 to 6 weeks. We said no we dont want wait again they said you have no choice however you can go to the store and talk with them to do a refund. We said we did already went before and the agent there didnt see the order we are charged for and he can not do anything, then the bank agent said go and talk to someone of the managers. 
So we went again to the store and asked to speak to a manager. We spoke with Mr. XXXX XXXX who did really good job trying to find out why this happen and the good thing is the agent we did the return with was there and XXXX asked him about the return. The Agent said yes, they did the return and there was no problem with it or anything unusual and then XXXX called the bank from the store phone to ask why I have got this charge and he inform them that I did return this order I got charge for, also he asked if they can get this done now and end this hassle, as the customer is very frustrated here now and for a long time already. The bank said no we must wait again, so he asked : Why did the bank asked the customer to go back to the store and you know we have nothing to do with that payment? The bank has no answer for that. 
XXXX was very sorry for us and said from his side he wishes if he can help or make a refund, but he can not see the order from his end to make any refund or cancel payment. 
He also advise us to avoid buying open box online and it is better to get it at the store, as it did happen many times this mistakes, as its good if we see the product in the store and try it before we buy it especially when it comes to open box items. 
He also gives us a return copy of the receipt and wrote on it that he sees no problem with the return, as I have also scan and will send with this letter, please see attached. 
So now we are waiting again, and we must wait for another 4 to 6 weeks. 
So our complaint here is against Best Buy and Citibank As for Best Buy : They did charge our credit card with no authorization from us and even never contact us to make clear with us anything before charging us for an order we already return at the store. 
As for Citibank : The company that manages the credit card, they should have acting against whomever charge dour card with no authorization from the card holder, and in fact they did not and even was helping to hide the mistake that Best Buy have committed against us. Which is against the Law and Credit Card Regulation. 
This problem is causing us me and my husband a big nightmare all this time since we did this order on XX/XX/XXXX Also did affect our credit score mine and my husbands credit score. My credit has always been Exceptional. During this whole ordeal, my credit card score has gone down 100 points. This significant decrease in credit has affected our life in so many ways. 
We are looking to get our right back from Best Buy and Citibank and let them pay us the most penalty possible to be an example for them to never do this with other customers out there again. 

The Order details : XXXX All in one PC Order date : XX/XX/XXXX Order Best Buy Number : # XXXX Last 4 numbers of the credit card used for the order : XXXX Card Holder : XXXX XXXX Please see attached with this from a copy of the return receipt with the store managers statement on it that the return was done at the store with no problems along with his business card. Also included is our bank statement copy and City Bank answer. 
Here is yours respectfully and sincerely, looking forward for your fair judgment, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or if there is anything not clear. 

Thank you Kind Regards, XXXX XXXX P.S- Also, we have not received all of the letters from Citi Bank regarding our disputes.

05/20/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,"I received a letter last week, regarding a dispute I filed. The letter advised me to close my debit card and to call the number on the letter. When I called the CSR said that there was NO issue with my ca rd or account. I asked if I could read the letter to them, and I did. She repeated her first statement, t here is nothing wrong with the card or account and to disregard the letter. On XX/XX/20 I went online to check my account balance for a DD. I was unable to login. I called CS at Citi, the person said not hing was with my account and transferred me to the IT dept. They said that a hold was on my acco unt and that i needed to speak to the fraud department about my dispute. On XX/XX/20. I was on the phone with Citi for 2 1/2 hours and was transferred to 7 different departments, all departments gave me conflicting information. One CSR said they were reissuing me a debit card and that I should be able to go back online in 5 minutes, because she removed the block ( which was a lie ). The next CSR said they blocked my account because I attempted to add my debit card to XXXX XXXX. The last CSR I spoke with said there was a hold on my account and that it was being handled "" behind the scenes '' and that I should go to a bank branch to withdraw cash. When I went to the bank the branch m anager made me wait in the lobby while she called someone. She came back and said that she doe s n't have any info and that they will send me a letter in mail. All of money is at that bank. I'm unable to get my Unemployment payment out and pay my bills, I've been out of work since COVID19. No employee at the bank has told me anything about when I could access my funds only that a letter would be sent out in 15 business days. I forgot to mention that everyone I spoke to over the phone wa s a "" manager ''. I'm unclear as to why a bank can keep and money and not tell me why??",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MI,483XX,None,Consent provided,Web,05/27/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3661168
05/13/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Didn't receive terms that were advertised,"My name is XXXX XXXX, I am currently a Citi checking ( account # : XXXX ) and saving account holder ( account # : XXXX ), as well as Citi credit card holder for nearly XXXX years. I applied the Citibank Account Package on XX/XX/XXXX, with a promotion to earning up to {$500.00} after meeting certain requirements ( later I was told that the promo code is XXXX ). 

Upon submitting the applications, I received two emails indicating the last four digits of my checking and saving account numbers ( see the following Email 1 ). However, for the next several weeks, I had gotten no communications from Citibank, either in physical mail or email/call to inform my application. I was assuming that due to COVID-19, the marketing team was busy with other essential matters. Therefore, I chose to wait. 

In the middle of XXXX and around XX/XX/XXXX, I couldn't help but tried myself to contact the new account department to check the status. In my thoughts, if the application was declined, I should at least receive a letter explaining it ; if the application was approved, I should see a debit card delivered to my address. However, during both calls, after a 2-hour waiting in the line, I was told that I still needed to wait more time as the application was still under review. I even asked whether I need to provide more supportive documents to facilitate the process. I got the answer "" No documents needed '' and a promise "" Just to wait '' over the phone. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a reminder email from Citi to state clearly these requirements to earn XXXX dollars ( see the following Email 2 ). At that time, I didn't have any information about my newly opened accounts, except the last XXXX digits account numbers, nor was I able to fund my new accounts or set up a direct deposit. Also, at that time, I assumed the application was not completed yet, and I shouldn't worry too much about the qualifications. 

Time flies. As of the middle of XXXX, I still got no communications from Citi. I redialed the new account department around XX/XX/XXXX, only to be told that my application almost came to an end, and I shall receive a debit card with 7-10 business days. It was until then that I was informed that my account opening day was XX/XX/XXXX, and all promotional qualifications started since XX/XX/XXXX as well. The agent herself thought it made no sense to count days from XX/XX/XXXX and suggested me to further contact after receiving cards and finishing online access setting-up. 

Eleven days later, I received my debit card to set up user-ID and finally got access to my full account number and routing number. Then I called to check with the new account department to get a detailed history of my account approval process. It turned out that not a single supportive document was required during the process, and my account application was not finally approved until XX/XX/XXXX, despite the last four digits account number was given to me on XX/XX/XXXX. In total, it took 57 days to get it processed. However, in the system end, the promotion qualification date still started since XX/XX/XXXX, requiring a new XXXX fund within 30 days and a direct deposit within 60 days. That being said, when I get ready to transfer funds, I am already disqualified. 

I am suggested by a customer service agent to submit this promotional dispute and get me qualified for this bonus, to which I should have been entitled. The delays in getting ready to fund accounts are not my faults nor within my control. I'll appreciate it if a reasonable solution can be offered.

Frankly, this is abusive.

Then when you use the card Macy 's wants to complain and the lower the credit limit ( which Macys has done twice with my account ) and then not renew your account. A growing and popular trend among credit card companies is to frequently pull a credit report on a consumer to "" review '' their account and then lower or decrease the credit limit closer to whatever the balance is on the card at the time of the "" review '' and then complain that the consumer is using too much of the credit limit or that the proportion of balance to credit limit is too high. Then the credit card companies expect the consumer to pay the full balance while at the same time continuing to charge interest on an account the consumer may no longer be able to use and refuse to work with the consumer for an amicable solution.

Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I called an additional eight times and spoke with more than 20 Citi employees. They advised me to file a police report, which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. A copy of the report is attached to this complaint. Citi still refuses to update my address, proactively communicate with me in any way, refund my money, or close the account even though they know that it is being used fraudulently. 

Citi reps have told me to knock on doors around my neighborhood to find out who used the card, told me to stop calling, that I should be glad that it's not a huge amount of money, that I should "" get a life, '' and numerous other unprofessional comments. They've also given me contradictory and conflicting information about the account and how I can get this resolved.

05/27/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"Below is a copy of a letter that I am sending to Macy 's Corporate Office. 
XXXX To whom it may concern, I have been a Macys American Express credit card account holder for many years. The account ends in *** according to the Macys website. I intended to use that account when I made a purchase at the XXXX XXXX XXXX Macys located in XXXX, VA on XX/XX/XXXX. The purchase was a bottle of cologne, totaling {$70.00}. At that time, the sales associate suggested that I apply for a Macys Credit Card account. I stated that I already had one and gave her the necessary information to access that account, as I did not have my Macys credit card with me at that time. After pulling up my current Macys account with the information that I provided, she stated that I was eligible for some type of upgraded account, and if I opened one, I would receive 20 % off of my purchase. I agreed, and she processed the application for this upgraded account. I was given paperwork for the account and the transaction was completed. She then told me that This new account will replace your current Macys Credit Card account. The cost of the cologne was {$70.00}, and I was told that the discount would be reflected on my bill. I left the store assuming I had opened a new Macys credit card account.

About one week later, I received a letter from Macys stating that though I have been approved for a Macys American Express Card account, I could not be approved for a Macys Credit Card Account because I already have one with them. Their policy does not permit the opening of multiple accounts, and therefore they were unable to offer me the Macys Credit Card account. I have this letter. Its reference number is **********. This tells me that I only have one Macys Credit Card account, the one that I have had for years, ending in ****. This account is connected to my XXXX XXXX XXXX checking account via eBills. At no point did I receive any notifications of an eBill from Macys. I have not received an eBill from Macys on that account since prior to XXXX of XXXX. 

I have logged into my Macys Credit Card account and show no charges for either the Macys Credit Card account nor the Macys American Express card credit accounts. 
Apparently, despite what that letter dated XX/XX/XXXX says, an account WAS opened in my name, and the charge for the cologne was posted to that account. I received no documentation through the mail until the end XXXX, XXXX. This was a bill showing a payment due date of XX/XX/XXXX. This was the first statement that I received, and it did not arrive until near the end of XXXX. Shortly after that, I received another bill with a payment due date of XX/XX/XXXX. That bill showed a late fee and interest. No charges were showing on my Macys Credit Card account, nor had I received any eBill to my XXXX XXXX  XXXX Account. My XXXX bill then came with additional fees and interest. I contacted Macys customer service and explained my situation. Clearly an account was opened in my name despite having a letter in my hands that stated that no account was opened because an account could not be opened due to me already having an account. After spending some time on the phone, I was told that one of the late fees could be removed, but the remaining late fees could not be, the interest charges would also remain, and I would be responsible for paying the bill in full. I requested to speak to a supervisor but was told that I would be told the same thing. I informed the customer service representative that I was willing to pay only the original charges, and that I would not be paying any fees or interest, and I wanted to know why an account was opened when I have a letter stating that an account could not and would not be opened. He wasnt able to explain how that happened and reiterated that he could not remove all of the charges and interest fees. I again requested to speak to a supervisor. I was put on hold. When the representative returned to the call, I was informed that the supervisor stated that he would tell me the same thing and that there was no reason for me to speak to him. I again explained that I would not be paying any additional fees or interest over the original sales price, and if they were removed, I would be happy to pay the bill in full immediately. The representative advised that he could not remove all the fees and interest, and I advised him that I would be making no payments to my account. 

I have since continued to receive monthly statements with additional interest and fees. Today I called XXXX, as that number was on a letter that I received regarding my account. I spoke with a representative and a supervisor and again explained the situation. I was told that nothing could be done about the fees and interest. I advised that this was my last call to them and that I would be contacting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as well as the credit reporting agency with this issue in order to get it resolved. 

I am enclosing a copy of the letter that I received, dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating that an account was unable to be opened for me. You may contact me at either my email address, XXXX, or my phone number, ***-***-****.

The complaint is about my CITI credit card being declined for a {$620.00} transaction when my credit limit is {$7000.00} and when I have a XXXX balance in my account and consistently paying the entire amount of my past due balance way before the due date. In fact, I just paid my balance of {$690.00} out of my XXXX XXXX account electronically on XX/XX/2020 ( which is still due on XX/XX/XXXX ) that same day before I went to do this transaction with XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

What type of problem are you having? 
I was shattered by the disgrace of a declined credit card and have to experience aggravating inconvenience of a credit card paralyzed at the worst possible moment when I was in a situation that I have to be quicker to go back to my Assisted Living and monitor my elderly vulnerable residents. This is in spite of the fact that I havent had any derogatory record with CITI credit card company as I always ensure that I dont reached my credit limit, in spite of the fact that all information I gave them match my records, in spite of the fact that I havent missed any credit card payments and even pay my balance way before my due date, and in spite of the fact that my credit card is not expired. Few things are more humiliating than trying to pay for an item with your credit card only to be told the card is declined in addition to the embarrassment this cause me in a crowded store. 

What happened? 
This complaint is about an incident that happened yesterday, XX/XX/2020 at about XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX when I was about to pay a {$620.00} worth of goods with my CITI Credit Card and to my surprise it got declined three ( 3 ) times. So, I called the CITI Customer Service and waited for about 10 minutes before I was able to speak to a representative. I identified myself politely and calmly stating my full name and explained the reason for my call but the lady representative wanted information about the account and routing number of the XXXX XXXX account I was using to pay my bills. I told her that I dont have in my possession my check book but she rudely insisted that thats the only way I could be identified. I replied to her politely if I can give my social security number or answer any personal information that I have on their file so I can be identified. But she straight up tells me that it would only be through my account and routing number that I can be identified. So I requested to speak to her manager and after several minutes of waiting I finally had Ms. XXXX ( Im not sure if I got her name right ). Ms. XXXX asked for my cell phone number so she can send me a code so that I can be identified. I gave her back the code number and so I was verified. She then assured me that my CITI card wont have any more problem. I closed the conversation and put in my card again to pay the {$620.00} and it got declined again. The store clerk tried to use another machine in another counter but to no avail. So I called CITI Customer Service for the second time and a male receptionist asked my name and the reason for my call ( I dont know why they would ask me same questions when the last call I had I was told that it was on a recorded line ) but I patiently gave every information they asked and once more I was asked for my account number so I can be identified. I must go online banking with XXXX on my cell phone just to get that information taking me about a couple of minutes to acquire it. After giving this information this male representative guaranteed that this time my card would be fine. I didnt hang up the phone while I tried using the CITI card and it got declined yet again. The CITI representative could not just figured out why my card kept getting declined and placed me again on hold for several minutes and came back telling me that he got it resolved, gave me a couple of reasons and have me tried the card again and it got declined for the 10th time. The customer service representative had me on hold for several minutes again and came back really confused and couldnt find any explanation why my card is being declined and then my call just got hanged up. I have no option but to pay my transaction with my XXXX XXXX debit Visa card. This CITI credit card company wasted 45 minutes of my time when I should be back to my facility and monitor my elderly residents in my assisted living knowing the current situation for the elderly population in the County of XXXX XXXX how they are so vulnerable to the Covid-19 virus. I waited for a call back all throughout that day, but no one called me back from CITI credit card company to explain what really happened to my card. What I got is a text message from Citi Costco Fraud Dept. with a note that they need to verify activity on my card and asking me to call them and specify case number which they indicated in their text message. 
I have been a customer in good standing with this credit card company as I pay my entire balance in advance way before the due date. In fact, I just paid them {$690.00} yesterday also and so I had a XXXX ( XXXX ) balance when I was doing this {$620.00} transaction with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have a credit limit of like {$7000.00} in this credit company and I or anyone dont deserve this kind of poor service and more seriously deprived of a {$620.00} credit when I am not delinquent of any past due balance. 

What company is this complaint about? 
CITI Credit Card Company What are the people involved? 
CITI Credit Card Customer Service Manager and  Representatives I spoke with on a recorded line. No one of them resolve the issue and had any explanation why my CITI credit card is being declined. I was deprived of the highest customer satisfaction service. The CITI credit card company customer service personnel lack empathy.

02/03/20,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"On XX/XX/XXXX I made the minimum payment due of {$240.00} for our Home Depot account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I went into the store to make a {$5000.00} payment intended to pay off a promotional balance and pay down the card balance. My husband and I are paying down/paying off accounts in conjunction with a refinance and were timing transactions to report to the credit bureau and adjust our credit rating to ensure that we could qualify for a 0-1.99 % interest rate offer that expires on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XXXX I called Home Depot Credit services because I received the bill and noticed my payment was not allocated correctly. They applied the entire amount to our revolving balance in lieu of paying off the promotional balance in the amount of {$1400.00} and having the remainder pay down the revolving balance. We made the payments in a specific fashion on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to avoid what is currently {$620.00} worth of deferred interest and because all previous communications ( documented in their system ) stated and reiterated that the default allocation method within 60 days of the promotion expiration would be as follows : 1 ) Minimum amount due applied to revolving balance 2 ) Remaining amount of payment applied to the promotion. 

I was on the phone with Home Depot Credit Services for greater than 1 1/2 hours today ( XX/XX/XXXX ). The first representative I spoke with, XXXX, tried to reallocate the payment but said that she couldn't because I was not the primary cardholder on the account. I explained that if she looked into the details/note on the account she should see that all previous calls/transactions were done so by me. I also explained to her that my husband had sent in a form authorizing me to handle this account previously. She said the system physically would not allow her to do it because she was in the account under my name. I asked her why the system did not allocate like it should have ... and she stated that she wasn't sure. She confirmed that I was correct in my understanding of how payments should be allocated. Stating ... '' There was something definitely wrong '', but the system wouldn't let her fix it. I verified with her that the call was being recorded ... she said yes that it should be. 

She transferred me to SCRA Services incorrectly and they transferred me back to HD Credit services. This time I spoke with XXXX who also said he couldn't do anything to reallocate the money because I was not the primary account holder. I stated that I wasn't asking for specific amounts to be put anywhere. I was asking that the allocation be corrected to how it was "" supposed '' to be allocated. He confirmed that the account was paid within the 60 day window ( 57 days to be exact ) and that it should have paid the promotional balance in full. Again I verified with him that he believed the call was being recorded before I asked for an escalation. 

XXXX escalated the call to XXXX. He admitted that he understood it was common practice to communicate 60 days in lieu of 2 billing cycles. I explained that I had spoken to numerous HD credit services representatives ( 2 of which were just previous to speaking with him ) that specifically verified it was 60 days prior to the promotional expiration. I explained that if it was indeed 2 billing cycles then other communications with HD credit services were incorrect and intentionally misleading. It seemed suspect that they would knowingly misrepresent the payment allocation method to consumers that specifically inquired about it. 

In addition, I explained that I was working to rebuild our credit by making this payment in time to have the payment positively reflect on my credit report for other financial transactions. He proposed an alternative to refund the money that I could then reapply and have it allocate correctly. It completely caught me off guard, and I expressed my concern, that their "" policy '' would allow them to issue a refund check ( non secure at all ) at MY request, but they would not reallocate a payment on the account the way that it was supposed to have been allocated to keep the money on the account. In addition, because the new balance still was not showing on my credit report, there was potential that the payment would show on my credit report as a decrease and then a drastic increase again due to the refund depending on timing and the mail. This seemed far from an optimal resolution, that could have additional negative financial implications. 

I asked XXXX if there was an option to further escalate to someone who would be able to allocate the payment correctly. He said he could escalate but he wasn't sure they would be able to do anything. He contacted XXXX in the Executive Response Unit. 

I restated the issue for the 4th time to XXXX and she said that it didn't allocate the way I was told it should because it was not within 2 billing cycles. She said normally, the 60 days they stated falls within the 2 billing cycles, but this time it didn't. To further put things into perspective, I paid the $ XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and the billing cycle started on XX/XX/XXXX. Absolutely ridiculous. 

I asked her where it was stated that it's billing cycles in lieu of 60 days as communicated and she originally stated it was on the bill. Then after she reviewed it and I reviewed the bill while still on the phone, she admitted that it was not stated on the bill. She then said, that she believed it was on the terms sent out when the account was opened. For the record and for recording purposes, I verified that I've spoken to several HD account services representative who expressly provided information to the contrary since the time we've received the terms when the account was opened. 

I let her know, that although the representatives were respectful and appeared cooperative, I firmly believed HD credit services was practicing misleading and deceptive communication practices and that I would be reporting them to the CFPB. She stated that these complaints come to her area. I'm reporting this despite the fact that she gave me the impression that my issue would not receive another look or consideration. 

It makes no sense, when consumers are doing everything within the parameters provided by the company to work their way out of debt that companies are allowed to engage in business practices that entrap and/or expressly inhibit the consumers ability to be successful. 

Three ( 3 ) HD Credit services account representatives, today alone, said the payment allocation went to the promotion 60 days from the promotion expiration date. It would have been easy for them to do a one time reallocation of the payment to pay off the promotional balance admitting that they communicated the terms incorrectly. Especially in light of the fact that they admitted the miscommunication. Instead, their predatory practice of hindering payoff will most likely cause an unnecessary {$700.00} in deferred interest be applied to our balance to which they will continue to accrue additional interest. 

I told all of the representatives that my husband worked on a secure facility and that he wasn't allowed to have his cell phone for me to call him. I also told them that I managed this account and had been doing so with his permission for a long as it's been opened. They made no attempt to verify that I was the person who made all payment allocation inquiries previously, they made no attempt to verify that my husband filled out a form to keep on file that I had permission to do so. They made no attempt to review the account at all. 

Everything my husband and I are doing is to make ourselves more financially sound and credit worthy. We believed we were doing everything right and playing by the rules. And yet, we're in a situation where we even lose when we try to do the right thing and pay off debt. These predatory practices and "" policies '' of misrepresenting information and/or intentionally misleading the consumer are egregious acts which should not be overlooked and allowed to continue.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",VA,233XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,02/03/20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3518724

The agreed cost of this service was a one-time fee of {$1200.00}, as per attached contract. 

I gave the sales person my Citibank MasterCard ending in XXXX to process the {$1200.00} agreed charge. 

The tent with fumigation was installed on XX/XX/XXXX and removed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX charged my Citibank MasterCard ending in XXXX the amount of {$1200.00} ( see copy of credit card statement ). ( charge # 1 ) On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX the merchant charged my Citibank card another {$1200.00}. ( charge # 2 ) Unauthorized On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX the merchant charged again for the third time my Citibank card {$1200.00}. ( charge # 3 ) UNAUTHORIZED I disputed two of the three charges. 

As per my contract I only agreed to a ONE TIME charge of {$1200.00}. 

Which I have already been charged for by XXXX to my Citibank MasterCard # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 
That charge appears on my statement billing period XXXX along with the 2 other illegal charges that I disputed. 

This charge for {$1200.00} dated XXXX was paid IN FULL to Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX electronically confirmation number XXXX. 

One of the disputes has already been resolved. 
This explanation and the proof of my credit card statement as well as your records should have taken care of the second dispute. 


As per the contract I signed the number of charges should have only been one {$1200.00} charge to my MasterCard # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 


It is my understanding that Citibank disputes are handled individually and by different investigators but in this particular case the situation would have probably been resolved sooner had it been handled by the same investigator. 

In closing and as a recap, my card was charged three times {$1200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. 

I only opened two disputes with Citibank MasterCard for the charge on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX see the attached statement and your records. 

I have no way of knowing whether or not Citibank disbursed the funds for the original charge of {$1200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX bank. 

My only knowledge is that I was charged the {$1200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, the only authorized charge and I have already paid it in full to Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX electronically confirmation # XXXX I have contacted Citibank numerous times regarding this matter. 
On a couple of occasions, I was told by different supervisor at Citibank disputes that the reasons this dispute keeps getting closed and not resolved in my favor is because I have used the wrong terminology. I have never worked for Citibank or MasterCard and I am unaware of the appropriate terminology. 

On XX/XX/XXXX spoke to a supervisor at the Citibank dispute who apologized to me saying the reason the matter was not resolved was because the dispute was entered incorrectly and needed to entered as a duplicate charge that he would correct the file. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I called to follow up and was told by different supervisor named XXXX that I needed to provide a letter stating duplicate charge. 
I wrote Citibank to that effect and provided a letter stating duplicate charge. 

On XX/XX/XXXX seeing once again the matter was unresolved, I called again Citibank disputes was told that the matter was no longer been investigated. 
I asked to speak to a supervisor. XXXX the supervisor proceeded to tell me that the reason why the matter was not resolved in my favor was because the charge could not be categorized as a duplicate charge. ( i guess the last supervisor was wrong ) He apologized and told me it is to be categorized as an unauthorized charge. 
Once again, as per request from supervisor XXXX, I sent a letter to that effect Unauthorized charge.. See all attachment ) This matter has been going on since XX/XX/XXXX. 
I feel victimized by Citibank and their process. All I know is I agree to a service from a merchant named XXXX for a {$1200.00} termite tenting and as of right now I am been charged {$2400.00}. 

Please help me resolve this situation as I has been a struggle dealing with Citibank and the clock is ticking ...

I have never had an issue paying the account, have not gone delinquent. I have used the card and paid as agreed for over 5 years. During XXXX, I was distracted caring for a sick family member and forgot to make the payment for early XXXX. When I logged in and saw that I was past due I immediately made the payment. They charged a late fee. Also, within the same week, they sent me a notification that my credit line was decreased. The reason the noted in the communication was that "" they show I have high utilization of other credit accounts. '' I take offense to this tactic of taking adverse action on a long time customer who is in good standing. During a crisis where all institutions, including Citi, say they are here to help and this is how I am treated. My credit utilization has been the same for the recent 2-3 years and I am current on all of my credit accounts, mortgage and car loans. Nothing is past due. To impact my credit line, charge a late fee during a global pandemic is unacceptable. Also, on this account, I have not used it recently - which should be viewed as me being responsible and paying down this debt and other debts. My high utilization will be further impacted by Citi reducing my credit line, which in turn will show me at a higher credit utilization for this account and my overall credit profile in general. I think it is an unfair practice. I am requesting that Citi reverse this decision, restore my account, which is in good standing and paid current, never past due.

Citibank unfairly resolved the case in favor of the merchant and reversed the chargeback. On XX/XX/2020, when I spoke to a Citibank billing dispute representative about it, he agreed that the resolution was unreasonable too but stated that Citibank could pursue the case no further. I asked him what evidence the merchant provided to prove that the charge was valid and he stated that the only evidence that the merchant provided was that the credit card was valid, the merchant claimed that there was a voice recording of my call with them ( but denied to provide said recording ), and a document of terms and conditions. A rational person would clearly understand that neither of those constitute as evidence.

He would hand me my bills, but he was quick to tear up everything. If I saw something with my name on it, I thought it was just some sort of advertisement to open a new card or transfer a card balance, junk mail.

02/04/20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem making or receiving payments,"I opened an interest checking account ( XXXX ) with Citibank N.A. in XX/XX/XXXX. I was subsequently provided with checks to utilize with this account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I tendered check # XXXX in the amount of {$2600.00} to the XXXX County Tax Collector for payment of the XXXX real estate property taxes pertaining to my primary residence. The balance of Citibank account XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX was {$3400.00} On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I received an fraud protection email from Citibank asking if I had in fact used check # XXXX to make a payment. This email included a graphic button that could be pushed to indicate affirmatively that I had tendered the check as payment, which I did. I continued to monitor the account throughout XX/XX/XXXX, noticing that check # XXXX never posted to account XXXX. I was never contacted by Citibank with further regard to check # XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received the attached notice from the XXXX County Tax Collector dated XX/XX/XXXX. This notice explained that Citibank had returned check # XXXX, and that as a result I was being assessed a {$25.00} returned check fee and a penalty of {$260.00}, which was calculated to be 10 % of my original tax bill. 

I immediately contacted Citibank on the evening of XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with a customer service representative and a supervisor. After explaining the situation, both representatives asserted that I had "" never activated the check writing features of the account ''. I argued that having the checking account open for five months and being provided with checks to write against the account implied that the account was ready to use. The representatives provided no explanation as to why the check was returned when there were sufficient funds in account XXXX to have check # XXXX negotiated successfully. 

After multiple circular arguments, I requested that the Citibank customer service manager close all of my depository accounts in the most expedient fashion possible. The manager readily agreed to close my accounts, making no effort whatsoever to assist me in resolving the situation in a favorable fashion. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted the XXXX County Tax Collector to ask if the returned check fee and penalty could be appealed or reconsidered. The XXXX County Tax Collector informed me that their office would only waive the returned check fee and penalty if Citibank provided a letter explaining that the returned check was not a result of insufficient funds. I was also informed by the XXXX County Tax Collector representative that interest and penalties had accrued since XX/XX/XXXX, the date of notice and that the amount due had changed to {$3000.00}. 

I then contacted Citibank customer service on XX/XX/XXXX to ask that the letter requested by the XXXX County Tax Collector be produced. The Citibank Customer Service representative refused to assist me in having this letter produced, instead telling me that I would have to travel to a branch location to request that such a letter be produced. When I told the Citibank Customer Service representative that Citibank did not operate any physical branch locations in North Carolina, my state of residence, she simply acknowledged that she knew this, and still refused to help me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I paid the XXXX County Tax Collector {$3000.00} to satisfy the outstanding tax liabilities, and avoid any further penalties. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received via email, a Customer Service satisfaction survey from Citibank regarding my call on XX/XX/XXXX. I completed the survey and requested that I be contacted further about my experience. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have never been contacted by Citibank.

Since my current checking account was debited for the total balance due on the payment due date, XX/XX/XXXX, I had no reason to think that any fees were billed or that I was delinquent with any payments to my account. It wasnt until XX/XX/XXXX that I made this discovery. I called customer service and they removed the fees, however, Bloomingdales reported to that I was 30 and 60 days delinquent to all three credit bureaus. I even spoke to supervisor, XXXX # XXXX, who said that it would be removed. A week later I received a letter from Bloomindales saying that the derogatory report could not be removed. Thank you for your time in correcting this urgent matter.

Then there was {$600.00} debited from my account. The problem is I have video proof and witnesses that will confirm I was at work not even in the same zip code.the next problem is that Citibank allowed someone to take money out of my account even when my balance was negative. Something else thats quite interesting is that non bank atms only allow you to pull {$200.00} at a single time max. I then reached out to Citibank and explained my problem and I was told that a new card will be issued and that they would restore my account I was also given the claim number XXXX, and told all would be taken care of in 10 business days ... ...

We took the cruise in XXXX, however the cruise was not as described on the purchase contract. The itinerary specified was not possible as the boat provided was not capable of traveling the distances required in the time required, resulting in us missing photography of the rare bird of paradise, which was the purpose of this trip. The food was not as described, it was poor, myself and my husband both had food poisoning from the ship food - resulting in us unable to participate in scheduled activities for 2 days each.

The decline made by Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX failed to show that they performed a substantial investigation and their conclusion was based on stale and inaccurate information from the merchant in XX/XX/XXXX. Citibank stated that the information I provided was not substantial documents. I provided the actual screen shots of the online chat with the airline representative to show that the tickets were not valid. I also documented the conversation I had with the airline representatives that the tickets were canceled by the merchant. If Citibank had truly performed the investigation, they would have found out that the merchant had gotten my refund from the airline since XX/XX/XXXX and that the airline would not provide substantial documents to the customers since the reservation was made via a travel agent. 

On XX/XX/2020XXXX, I spoke with XXXX XXXX representative, XXXX , regarding XXXX order, the representative confirmed that the refund was provided to the XXXX parent company, XXXX XXXX XXXX , on XX/XX/XXXX. This was the date that Citibank closed the case and debited my account. I emailed my refund requests to XXXX customer service numerous times, there was no response. On XX/XX/XXXX, the Communications Director, XXXX XXXX from XXXX responded to my email after I sent the request to the merchants CEO. Mr. XXXX denied of receiving the refund from the airline and provided inaccurate information stating that XXXX airline had told them that they were not able to apply a full refund and I have to proof that the airline would promise a full refund. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from the airline verifying that the refund for my reservation has provided to the travel agent. I provided the email proof to the travel agents CEO and Mr. XXXX, there was no response. The travel agent did not deliver the service to me on XX/XX/XXXX and took my money. 
I did make a flight reservation with the merchant, XXXX XXXX and I did receive the confirmation 8 days after placing the order. However, the service was supposed to deliver on XX/XX/XXXX did not deliver by the merchant. My departure date for this reservation was XX/XX/XXXX. The merchant unilaterally canceled my flight reservation on XX/XX/XXXX, some hour before my departure date. I provided the screen shots of the airline chat records to show that the tickets were not valid on my departure date, XX/XX/XXXX ( # 5 ). How did I get service from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX when they purposely canceled my flight tickets on XX/XX/XXXX? I performed the agents job to gather evidence from the airline to proof that both Citibank and the travel agent did not perform its due diligence. 
I understand Citibank wants to make fees out of this transaction by ignoring consumers rights. Based on Citibanks imprudent and irresponsible conclusion, I do not feel that I am protected under the Fair Credit Billing Act from unfair credit billing practices. I was charged for "" goods or services not received. While the airline has provided my refund to the travel agent, they failed to properly reflect payments or credits to my account, instead they stated that the airline did not told them to refund me ; and the merchant failed to provide written proof from the airline that a refund for the inquired reservation is not possible. With all the proof, Citibank still think the merchant entitles to the payment even though they did not provide me service. Citibank should provide training to its staff on how to investigate and analyze the dispute. 
Further, Citibank never accepted my complaint as a billing error. There was no record showing that such dispute was entered into my account. However, my clean account was reported to the credit agencies as past due. It was not my misunderstanding of Citibanks negligence. Citibank failed to investigate my account by imprudently put in a robotic and standard language to defame my good standing account. 

I dont know what kind of document is considered substantial to Citibank? All I know is that Citibank did not do its job. If Citibank wants to verify whether the facts provide by the customer are substantial, they should contact to the airline to verify the information instead of relying solely on the merchants outdated and invalid information. The merchant still show that the tickets are open in their internal system ( # 6 ). This is the merchants system, they can leave the ticket status :  open, canceled or closed. The airlines system has the final say. The airline is the one to collect the money and provide the refund. The tickets were booked via the travel agent ; hence, only the travel agent can request document from the airline. Citibank is well aware of the US travel agent rules, but they refuse to recognize the merchants fault or perform an investigation by victimized its customer.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,113XX,None,Consent provided,Web,05/12/20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3648488

I have and continue to have the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as my daily credit card. 

Citibank opened up a credit card without my authorization or approval or even knowledge and opened it because I had a Costco/XXXX  XXXX Credit Card. I never charged anything on the Citibank Credit Card and never opened it or gave authorization. 

I then started getting statements from Citibank that I owed annual fees and late fees and interest on these membership fees. When I explained that I never wanted this credit card and never gave authorization to open this card and never charged anything on it, I was continually told by Citibank that it was mandatory that every Costco/XXXX  XXXX Credit Card holder had a Citibank Credit Card opened. 

Citibank never budged when I explained that I never gave authorization to open this credit card and I should not owe fees for membership in a credit card I did not want and did not give authorization. 

Well, 4 years later I went to get a mortgage and on the credit card report it says that Citibank wrote off {$67.00} for me and then gave me a 9 ( the worst ) rating to the credit card agencies as punishment. 

This has damaged my credit card statement and is costly in getting a loan. {$67.00} write off and then a punishing 9 rating for annual fees, interest and {$0.00} charges on a credit card that I never wanted, never used, and certainly never gave Citibank authorization to open a credit card for me. 

This is punishing to me, not only was it a nightmare trying to get rid of a credit card that I never authorized, but now I found out that Citibank was vindictive and damaged my credit card report because of this. 

This does not seem appropriate and I would ask the Consumer Financials Protection Agency to start an investigation into Citibank regarding this abuse.

Therefore, Citi cancelled the credit card and sent me a replacement card. The unauthorized charges were removed as "" Security Credit '' In the meantime, the balance on my previous month 's ( XX/XX/XXXX ) was {$4600.00}, and I also had my own credit with them in the amount of {$70.00} and {$1000.00}, a total credit in the amount of {$1100.00}. So, on my XXXX Statement for replaced card showed that my XXXX chares of {$4600.00} was cleared from the credit. In the meantime, since I received the new card around XX/XX/XXXX, I was unable to access my credit card activities online for which I had t spend numerous hour with CITI Bank IT to have it fixed. This took 2 months before was able to access my charges activities, during which time CITI Bank kept calling me for payment of the past due amount to which I informed them that I could not pay without seeing my charges, so I was told that they would have to mail me the hard copies of my Statements. I received my Statements towards the end of XXXX, on which I saw that the fraudulent charges were still present, so had to go back and forth with CITI to resolve the issue. According to CITI, after they removed the charges, The Merchant from where the fraudulent charges occurred processed a credit as well, in all of this we could not agree with the actual payment amount that was needed to be made. However, since XX/XX/XXXX, we had made new charges in the amount of {$59.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX, {$290.00}, a total charge in the amount of XXXX We were told by CITI, that although there is an on going dispute regarding the fraudulent charge, the best thing to do would be to clear the new charges ( {$350.00} ) which we did. On my XX/XX/XXXX Statement, the  charged in the amount of {$2900.00} XXXX the fraudulent charges ) appeared again. In the meantime, the total amount charged to me in the form of fees and interest charges is {$570.00}. To add to this, on XX/XX/XXXX, I was hospitalized for a XXXX XXXX   XXXX, which is why it is only now, that I am able to address this issue.According to my understanding, the amount due is {$3500.00} ( Not including the fees and interest charges ) which I have paid in full. 
From my end, I have paid the full amount I owed to CITI. I have spent countless hours with CITI on the phone trying to resolve this matter, getting a run around to talk to Customer Service, to Fraud Prevention Department, to Collections Department over and over and having CITI representatives hang up the call etc. All of these calls supposedly should be recorded, in case verification is needed!

I replied no to the text and received a subsequent text asking me to call the fraud department. I did. I was actually sleeping when the text came through, but I responded within an hour or two of receiving the text message. 

I called the fraud department and spoke to a CSR and we discussed the situation. The CSR asked me to verify some other purchases. I never made any purchases with this particular Citi card since I had it. I just kept it for the credit building purposes. Anyway, the CSR asked me about other charges for gas at some gas station, a charge for XXXX XXXX and something else. I told him I've never made purchases with this card and know of none of those places. 

The charges were all refunded back to the card. {$4300.00} to XXXX XXXX, {$4100.00} for XXXX, but nothing ever came through for gas or anything else. This was in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I logged into my account to see if credit from a different vendor had reached a different Citi card from a XXXX purchase, and I see a balance of {$4100.00} on the Citi Rewards card. That same night I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, indicating that Citi feels that I should pay for the {$4100.00} from XXXX because they think I had the card with me. I 100 % disagree with their findings and feel that I should not have to pay for a credit card charge that I did not make. I didn't have the card and Citi sent me a new card and asked me to cut up the previous card. I put that card away somewhere in a bin with other credit cards that I never use ; I just build my credit. 

I've never used this card for ANYTHING! I never even knew of the charges from the gas station or the XXXX XXXX until the CSR told me over the phone they there were there.

I fully complied with the terms of the offer, yet Citibank is refusing to give me any of the miles it owes me. 

In XXXX or XXXX of last year, I received in the mail a brochure offering XXXX Aadvantage miles if I opened a Citi Priority Account package of {$50000.00} or more, spent {$750.00} on purchases with the account 's debit cards within 60 days, and made a qualifying bill payment for two consecutive months within the same 60-day period. On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened the account package at the Citibank branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX in Washington, DC. I presented the brochure to bank officer XXXX at the branch and he assured me that I would get the XXXX miles if I opened the account and fulfilled the rest of the terms with the debit card purchases and the bill payments. He added that IN ADDITION to the airline miles, I would receive a {$600.00} bonus for opening the account package. 

I opened the account package, and made the debit card purchases and bill payments within the 60 days. On several calls to Citibank 's national office, company officials confirmed I had complied with all the terms and would soon be receiving the miles. Yet I kept checking my Aadvantage account and seeing that the miles hadn't been added. Finally, when I called the national office in XXXX, the official suggested I talk to the branch manager at the location where I opened the account, and that's what I did. 

Yet when I talked to the branch manager, XXXX XXXX, she told me something completely different from everything I had been promised by XXXX and the officials on the phone. She said that because I received the {$600.00} bonus, I would not be receiving the XXXX miles. I told her that XXXX assured me I would receive both the miles and the bonus when I opened the account, and she conceded I made a mistake. She said he was mistaken. She told me I may be able to still get the miles, but only if I forfeited the {$600.00}. 

This is not acceptable to me. Had I been offered the choice as either/or at the time, I would have chosen the miles. But now I find it extremely problematic to forfeit the {$600.00} after being promised both. First, I think companies like Citi should keep their word. Second, I've already budgeted the money. And third, I've already received a 1099 tax form for the {$600.00}, so I'm expected to pay taxes on money I would now have to give back.

Borrowers did later marry in XXXX and also divorced in XXXX, final judgement XX/XX/XXXX. Borrower # 2 kept the house and was to refinance. In XXXX, borrower # 1 ( myself ) applied for a refinance of a current mortgage held by me on a different property. My credit was found to have a delinquency on a mortgage with a balance of {$64000.00} by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called them immediately as I have purchased two homes, numerous vehicles, etc ... and viewed my credit report numerous times in detail and never has this mortgage shown up. My call to XXXX revealed that I remain on the mortgage and the note of the home mentioned above, dated XX/XX/XXXX. I then called the servicer prior to XXXX, XXXX XXXX, who informed me that I was not on the mortgage when it was in their service. Upon further investigation, and information mailed to me by XXXX, I was informed that the mortgage had been modified in XXXX. I was not aware that this mortgage will still open, nor was I aware a modification had occurred. The modification states the "" New Principal Balance to be {$65000.00} and changes the terms of the mortgage from a maturity date of XX/XX/XXXX to a maturity date of XX/XX/XXXX. The mortgage modification document appears to be from CitiMortgage, Inc. It's opening line addresses both borrowers by name, including myself.

The final page also states "" Accepted and agreed to by CitiMortgage Inc. Successor by Merger to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX "". I have attempted to have this removed from my credit but told that I remain on the mortgage and note. If this is accurate, and I am still held accountable for this mortgage, how was it acceptable and rightful to modify the mortgage without my consent? If I remain on the mortgage and note, then an additional 24 years of debt responsibility was placed on me without my consent. There are indications on credit markings that the loan has been modified more than once, however this is the only paperwork I can find. Other servicers don't show me as responsible or on the mortgage so they decline to provide me with info ( XXXX for example ). Either I am on the mortgage/note or I am not. If I am not, my credit should not reflect any default by borrower # 2. If I am, then no modifications should have been made without my consent. Obtaining mortgage information on a mortgage that has directly and suddenly shown up on my credit when previously not there for nearly 2 decades, has been near impossible. CitiMortgage homeowner support team offers me nothing and states there are no mortgages that reflect my name, nor do they have the provided servicer number in their system ( info directly from the modification agreement ). I am in a very difficult situation as a consumer. Backed into a corner in which I am told by some that I am responsible for this, yet I can not get answers or information from all sources.

I would have never consented to any sort of modification. As a consumer, I feel I have been taken advantage of by a mortgage company that chooses to report to the credit bureau with my name, yet changes terms without my consent. The modifications are reflected on 2 credit bureaus reports of mine, yet I wasn't asked for consent.

05/03/20,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I filed a dispute with Citi Cards ( CitiBank ) on XXXXfor a charge on my Citi Master Card credit card, for an amount paid to a merchant for work I found was never done at all on my XXXX XXXX XXXX. The dispute # is XXXX. This dispute with Citi has been an ongoing nightmare for me in the fact they have requested the same information and documentation repeatedly. I have sent the information and documentation to them as requested via USPS Priority Mail ( tracking # s available ), and I have also emailed the same documents and information to them at least 4 times.

In addition, I have tried to call the Citi Card Dispute Department seven ( 7 ) times and was only able to get a hold of someone in that department once on XX/XX/XXXX! I was on hold twice for more than an hour waiting for a customer service representative to transfer me to the dispute department. I have been disconnected on a regular basis when trying to reach the dispute department at Citi Cards. There is no direct telephone number for the credit card dispute department at Citi Cards ; however there is a direct telephone number for the banking dispute department! Citi Cards just told me this morning, XX/XX/XXXX, when I tried to contact the Citi Card Dispute Department once again. This is only part of the issue ; it is near impossible to get a hold of anyone in the Citi Card Dispute Department to speak with about the issues I have been trying to resolve with this dispute. I have spent hours upon hours trying to reach a person to speak with in the Citi Cards Dispute Department.

I was also provided with an email address when I filed the dispute for which to send documents and information. However, I received a letter from Citi Cards dated  XX/XX/XXXX ( not received until XX/XX/XXXX ) that has an entirely different email address included in the letter for which to send correspondence and documentation! It is an ever changing game with Citi Cards ; I have continually received misinformation concerning this dispute, and City Cards has made numerous errors concerning this dispute all of which are, and have been, documented.

Based on the confusion and inconsistent information concerning this dispute, it appears that the Citi Cards dispute department has several different staff members handling the dispute based on the fact that I get different information, contradictory information, and have noted to them many errors they have made concerning this dispute.

The most significant error made by Citi Cards in this dispute related to 2 separate letters I received from them. The first letter I received is dated XX/XX/XXXX ( I received it on XX/XX/XXXX ) and Citi requests a signed document from a merchant with their opinion that the work was not done on my truck to validate my dispute. The deadline stated in this letter from Citi to get this document to them is XX/XX/XXXX. I mailed the signed document Citi Cards requested on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX via USPS Priority Mail. It is scheduled to arrive at Citi Cards on XX/XX/XXXX as noted on the USPS receipt/tracking document. It also required a signature from someone in the dispute department at Citi Cards because they continue to request information I have already submitted to them. A copy of the receipt from USPS is attached with this complaint which confirms the information I am providing is absolutely correct and true.

On the day I mailed the document to Citi Cards, I received yet another letter from Citi dated XX/XX/XXXX ( not received until XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX ) which states in the first paragraph ; Unfortunately, we are unable to resolve this dispute in your favor since we have not received the valid similar merchant opinion. This statement from Citi Cards directly refutes their own statement in the letter from Citi Cards dated XX/XX/XXXX, wherein the deadline clearly states to provide the document by XX/XX/XXXX! Citi Cards also threatens me in this 2nd letter that my account will be reported to three credit reporting agencies if it is not paid by the due date on my billing statement! First of all, the amount being disputed is not even on my current billing statement due on XX/XX/XXXX. Secondly, I am extremely outraged at the extreme negligence in how this dispute is being handled and the significant errors Citi Cards has made over the course of trying to resolve this dispute. I was given a deadline to provide the document of XX/XX/XXXX but then someone else at Citi Cards decided to send another letter stating they did not receive the requested document ( even though the deadline is not until next week ) with threats to damage my credit! I repeat, I mailed the documents Citi Cards requested on XX/XX/XXXX and they will arrive by the due date! Whoever sent this 2nd letter clearly did not read through the history of this matter or the conversation notes I had with a manager in the Citi Cards Dispute Department confirming the date the requested documents are due, XXXX. This is a serious matter that is laden with errors on the part of Citi Cards Dispute Department. There are other errors Citi Cards has made and I have emailed them addressing these errors.

I believe that Citi Cards Dispute Department is not reading through the documentation and information I have provided to them over and over again, otherwise there would not be ongoing issues with this dispute. Obviously different people in the Citi Cards dispute department are sending me letters that contain inconsistent and erroneous information that can ultimately damage my good credit. This is a blatant violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and a violation of other federal laws that mandate the procedures in how credit card companies are required to handle credit card disputes. 
I always pay my bills in full and on time and my current credit rating is at XXXX. I know this because I just applied for a different credit card as I will definitely close this one as soon as this matter is resolved. The people on staff who are handling this dispute are  seemingly unaware of the laws that are supposed to be followed in handling customer disputes. 

As noted by the manager I was finally able to speak with in the Citi Cards Dispute Department on XX/XX/XXXX, mail delivery in the United States is very delayed due to the coronoavirus. He stated this because I told him I just received the letter from Citi Cards that is dated XX/XX/XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX!!! 

I am a senior citizen, but I am also educated, and I know enough to realize this dispute has been handled in ways that violate federal regulations concerning credit card disputes. Citi Cards has not done their due diligence in resolving this matter and most certainly have not treated me, the cardmember, in a fair and nondiscriminatory manner. Furthermore, it is almost impossible to get through to anyone on the phone in the Citi Cards Dispute Department as if there is no one working there on a consistent schedule.

They made up their mind on making a decision in favor of the merchant who failed to provide the goods and services that were charged to my credit care in the amount of {$1200.00} without even reviewing the documents they wanted and stated were due to them by XX/XX/XXXX. Today is XX/XX/XXXX and Citi made a decision to rule this dispute against me before their own stipulated deadline to receive the documents they requested of XX/XX/XXXX! Citi Cards is responsible for the ongoing mishandling of matters related to my credit card in an irresponsible manner since it was initially opened on XX/XX/XXXX. The actions on the part of Citi Cards go above and beyond violations of federal laws.

Since opening the account I had issues. I signed up for auto pay and it didn't register the correct bank account ( I never had this issue prior ) so after my first payment did not go through I signed in and updated my bank account. During the next billing their system again went to the incorrect bank account number. I had to make the payment manually to avoid missing a payment. I called customer service and asked them to delete all back accounts and manually add the correct bank account number. 

My next billing cycle I was billed less than the full amount that was due and I was charged interest. I called to understand why only partial amount showed up as sure they didn't have an explanation and just refunded the interest charge. 
Now I just log in and manually make a payment before the due date because I don't think their system will accurately debit the full amount due. 

I brought this up to the company but nothing was meaningfully done. 

When I log in to view what is due and go to set up an early payment, I end up seeing two amounts, one on the main page and another as full amount due on the manual payment page.

I was told by Citi that I could resolve it by calling the Fraud Department, but after making a lot of calls ( about 20 by now ) I was told the account is in "" review '' by the "" back office '' with no way to contact and that it is "" marked for closure ''. But none of them can tell me why nor provided a way to resolve it. I was told to wait for 30-60 days for them to contact me with the reason. 

In XXXX ( 60 days after the account was frozen ), I received a letter ( attached ) with cryptic message saying "" We periodically review customer accounts to assess the suitability of their banking relationship with Citibank. Pursuant to a recent review, it has been determined that we can no longer service your account ending XXXX  and your other related Citibank accounts. Based on this decision, we have taken steps to terminate your banking relationship ( s ) with Citibank. '' So after 60 days of locking my asset, Citi still does not provide clear explanation whatsoever as to why my account was locked and marked for closure. 

I made another call provided by the letter ( Fraud Prevention dept ) and was told ( again ) that the decision was made by the "" back office '' and that they do not take any calls. 

Worse yet, the letter says that the account closure will take up to 60 days. So basically Citi has no problem holding my money for 120 days but is unable to provide a sound explanation as to why. 

That is also 120 days of me unable to access my family 's savings that I really need especially during this time when businesses are closing and family 's are struggling. 

Because of this, I had to take a loan with high interest. 

I don't know what else to do here or who else to contact. We don't have a branch in my state. Citi Fraud Prevention is clueless. The "" back office '' is unreachable. Citi Executive Response Team is unable to help.
